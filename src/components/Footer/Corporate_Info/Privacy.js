          <h3>Voice Recording and Microphone Permission</h3>
          <p>
            In our app, we've implemented a unique and convenient way for you to
            ask questions and interact with us in your chat — by recording your
            voice as audio. Instead of typing out your queries, you also have an
            option to simply speak into your device's microphone, record the
            voice as audio, and then send it on chat. This audio interaction
            feature is designed to make using our app more intuitive and in tune
            with natural communication.
          </p>
          <p>
            To enable you to record your questions and thoughts in your own
            voice as audio, we need to request access to your device's
            microphone. When you grant us this permission, it allows our app to
            capture the sound of your voice as audio and convert it into digital
            data that we can process.
