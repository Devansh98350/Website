            In mole astrology, moles on the back, chest, and ribs are
            particularly significant. A mole on the back, for example, is said
            to indicate a strong and determined individual with a natural

            A mole on the chest, on the other hand, is believed to signify a
            person's emotional nature and capacity for love and affection. This
            type of mole is often associated with a loving and caring
            personality and someone who values emotional connections and
            relationships above all else.
          </p>
          <p>
            Meanwhile, a mole on the ribs indicates a passionate and adventurous
            spirit. Such individuals are bold and daring, unafraid to take risks
            and explore new experiences. They may be natural thrill-seekers and
            drawn towards exciting activities like skydiving or bungee jumping
            or have a keen interest in travel and adventure.

              People with a mole on the left side of the chest may also be
