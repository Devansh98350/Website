          <h1 className="heading">Astrological remedies for job promotion</h1>
          <p>
            Are you looking for a job? Or say astrological remedies to get a
            job? If yes, then this article will prove to be a boon for you. If
            we consider the current scenario, getting a promotion in a job is
            seriously getting a lot tougher than finding a new job altogether.
            Because when it comes to promotion these days, apart from just your
            skills, a lot more goes into the process. And due to the same
            reasons, a lot of deserving people are left out not getting the
            promotion that they deserve.
          </p>
          <p>
            Working hard and not getting the desired payment for it is a tough
            situation to be in. More than just the monetary benefits, a raise,
            increment or promotion affects a person's psychological state,
            prompting him or her to do better across all domains of life. And
            when that happens, growth follows for both the firm and the person.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, all the pep talk above is meaningless if the person is not
            getting the promotion he derives. So here comes the moral question,
            if not getting a promotion, do we still keep working hard or try to
            change the job or something else? Well, the first two options are
            surely your decisions to make, but recommending you ‘something else’
            that you can do to get a job promotion is our cup of tea.
          </p>
          <p>
            And playing out part well, we bring you in this write up some tried
            and tested astrological remedies to get a promotion. Like everything
            else, Vedic astrology surely has remedies for job promotion as well.
            The remedies for job promotion are easy to practise and ensure that
            any planet, if in case it is blocking the desired results for you,
            gets recirified. In fact, astrological remedies can also help an
            individual find a job if he or she is trying to find one. The
            remedies are so simple that even if working, you will still find the
            time to practise them for yourself. And that is what makes Astro
            Swarg the best astrology consultation platform in India.
          </p>
          <h3>
            Astrological reasons behind why you are not able to get a promotion
          </h3>
          <p>
            As per AstroSwarg astrologers, the 10th house in kundli is the one
            that controls aspects like job and business for the native. The
            tenth house in astrology is also indicative of a person’s karma.
            Apart from the tenth house, the lord of the tenth house controls an
            individual's performance in terms of worldly pleasures. Hence if the
            tenth house to tenth house lord in your Kundli is under the malefic
            effects of negative planets, then this can result in a hindrance in
            job promotion, business or sometimes even overall job and business.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, if the 10th house in Kundli is being occupied by the
            benefic planets, then, in that case, promotions may come easily for
            you. We use the word 'May' because the positivity of the 10th house
            alone is not responsible for promotion but your hard work too plays
            a role. In this, the Sun is the factor of goals and achievements.
          </p>
          <p>
            Mars, on the other hand, allows the native energy to accomplish his
            or her professional goals. Also, planet Mercury is the factor of
            intelligence and knowledge and can help in the career progression of
            the native. The next planet that gives good results in the 10th
            house is Jupiter. Jupiter brings new job opportunities to the door
            of the native and also helps you in earning from multiple sources.
            Apart from these planets, Shani Dev controls your Karma and rewards
            you based upon the hard work you are willing to put to do better
            professionally.
          </p>
          <p>
            If the 10th house of the kundli is being marred by a malefic planet
            or planets, auspicious results in jobs and business may not come
            easily to you.The placement can result in a delay in getting a job,
            termination, salary cut, dissatisfaction with the job and even delay
            in promotion. Nevertheless, any such negative placements of the
            planets can be studied through a person's birth chart and also
            corrected by following some simple astrological remedies to get a
            job or promotion.
          </p>
          <h3>Astrological remedies to get a promotion in Job</h3>
          <UnorderedList>
            <ListItem>
              To start with, the native trying to get a job promotion must
              recite mantras related to the tenth house. You can talk to our
              astrologers to find a suitable mantra to please the tenth house
              and its ruling lord.
            </ListItem>
            <ListItem>
              When multiple planets are bringing you trouble, then things can
              get even worse for you. In such a situation, the best solution is
              to perform a Navagraha Havan. The Havan should be done at the home
              of the native.
            </ListItem>
            <ListItem>
              If not Navagraha Havan, the native can also do Navagraha Abhishek
              at a temple to ward off the negative energies from your life. Both
              these havans not only help in job promotion but also help you get
              rid of the malefic effects of Rahu and Ketu.
            </ListItem>
            <ListItem>
              The next astrological remedy for job promotion is that you offer
              water to the Sun lord at the Sunrise and while doing so, chant
              Gayatri or Surya Mantra - “औं पुष्णे नमः”. The rays coming from
              the Sun Lord work as a purifier and give the person the power to
              fight the difficulties in life.
            </ListItem>
            <ListItem>
              If you are not able to find a job, then you must light a lamp of
              oil at any Shani Mandir on Saturdays. Along with that, chanting
              Shani Mantra is also advised. Chanting Shani Mantra curbs the ill
              effects of Shani, the planet which is a major controller of your
              progress in life.
            </ListItem>
            <ListItem>
              If you are a businessman and not able to make a profit in the
              same, then Vyapar Vriddhi Yantra can prove to be a boon for you.
              The positive effects of this yantra can resolve any money crisis,
              besides bringing you monetary gains.
            </ListItem>
            <ListItem>
              As per Vastu Shastra, the north direction of the house or office
              is related to career and business growth. Hence special attention
              to the north direction must be given. Always keep a container of
              water, fountain or aquarium in the north direction. Also, placing
              a picture with an abundance of blue or black colours in it will
              also be very beneficial for your career.
