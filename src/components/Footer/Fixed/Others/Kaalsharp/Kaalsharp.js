        <StyledParagraph>
          Kaalsarp dosh in astrology is considered as one of the most concerning
          doshas. According to astrology, Kaalsarp dosh is a result of one's
          past deeds or karma. The presence of this dosh in your kundli may
          create hurdles and delays across different aspects of your life such
          as career, love, marriage, health and more. The Kaalsarp dosh is
          formed when Rahu and Ketu are present on one side in the horoscope and
          all other planets are in their midst.
          <br />
          <br />
          As per astrology, there are seven main planets (excluding Rahu and
          Ketu), each of them ruling various aspects such as Lagna, wealth,
          happiness, children, disease, household, age, fortune, karma, profit,
          love, expenditure, etc. As Kaalsarp dosh veils the planets, the
          aspects they represent may get hampered, which may lead to problems in
          the life of the native. In astrology, there are as many as 12 Kaalsarp
          doshas. Each of these forms as per the placement of Rahu and Ketu in
          the native's chart.
          <br />

        <StyledSubHeading>1. Anant Kaalsarp Dosh</StyledSubHeading>
        <StyledParagraph>
          The Anant Kaalsarp dosh is formed in the native's chart when the
          planet Rahu is present in the lagna or the first house of the Kundli,
          and Ketu is present in the 7th house. In this way, all the remaining
          planets come in between the two shadow planets. When the native has
          this dosh in his Kundli, he will have to struggle for longer to find
          success. Although you will work very hard in order to succeed, but the
          results will come to you after a delay. The Anant Kaalsarp dosh will
          likely test your patience by introducing you to constant obstacles and
          challenges. Due to this dosha, a person faces problems in all aspects
          of their lives, but if you don't lose hope, you will find success
          later. Also, don't indulge in ill deeds such as gambling, lust, etc.

        <StyledParagraph>
          Kulik Kaalsarp dosh is formed when Rahu is placed in the 2nd house and
          Ketu is in the 8th house of the native's kundli. This dosha is
          believed to bring economic losses, humiliation, debt and various other
          obstacles in the native's life. Hence astrologers suggest that you
          don't form bondings with people without careful scrutiny. If you are
          into business, make sure you do it with 100% honesty, especially
          during the Kulik dosh period. When it comes to married life, it is to
          remain normal for the native dealing with Kalik dosh. You, however,
          may feel that you are getting old before time, thus you must invest in
          taking care of your health. Do not use intoxicants such as cigarettes,
          tobacco, etc.

        <StyledParagraph>
          Vasuki Kaalsarp dosh is formed when Rahu is placed in the 3rd house in
          the native's chart and Ketu, on the other hand, sits in the 9th place.
          This dosha doesn't only hamper the life of the native but also of the
          ones related to him, such as his siblings, parents, spouse, etc. You
          have to face the fact that your family members may cheat on you. There
          will likely be a lack of peace in the family, and the peace will
          further shatter with inflating economic problems as the Vasuki
          Kaalsarp dosh continues. However, the good thing is that the person
          will have economic success as he continues to put in the hard work in
          making sure things work out for him.

        <StyledParagraph>
          The Shankphal Kaalsarp dosh is formed in the native's Kundli when the
          planet Rahu is placed in the 4th house of the Kundli and the planet
          Ketu sits in the 10th house. The formation of this yoga in kundli is
          the signal of incoming financial hardship, disease and disorder in the
          native's life. Hence, he/she should prepare for it. During this
          period, the happiness in the native's family will plunge to new lows.
          This may further hamper elements such as love, child's education, etc.
          If a youngster, the native will find it tough to make the right
          choices, due to which he or she may find it difficult to settle early
          in life. The people of this yoga have to face difficulties related to
          land and property, thus any such deals must be done after proper
          scrutiny.

          Padam Kaalsarp dosh is formed when Rahu is placed in the 5th house and
          Ketu is in the 11th house of the kundli. This dosh is especially
          harmful to students as they may lose concentration in studies and
          indulge in detrimental deeds. Hence, parents must keep an eye on their
          children during this period. You also need to ensure you help your
          child make the right choices in education or it will simply cost you
          and him a loss of money and time. For grown-ups, the dosh may hamper
          your progress in your career. If you are looking for new opportunities
          or taking risks, you must do it with a partner. Also, health should be
          a priority as the Padam Kaalsarp dosh progresses.

          The Mahapadma Kaalsarp dosh is formed when the planet Rahu is placed
          in the 6th house of the Kundli and Ketu is placed in the 12th house.
          Although Kaalsarp doshas are known for their ill consequences, but
          when Mahapadma Kaalsarp dosh is active, the native finds himself the
          luck to win over all his enemies with ease. There is an enhancement in
          wisdom and a thrust of will to do something worthwhile and big in
          life. However, as the dosh period continues, the native tends to lose
          peace of mind and may make thoughtless choices. In the dosh period,
          the person earns profit from business from abroad.

          The Takshak Kaalsarp dosh is formed when Rahu is placed in the 7th
          house of the Kundli and Ketu is in the lagan or the 1st house. If this
          dosh is active in the life of the native, he or she may have to face a
          delay in marriage. The marriage delay may become the reason for
          tension and stress for your parents too. If married, there may be
          disturbances due to the nature of the in-laws. There may also arise
          situations when you might think of divorce. Also, the ones dealing
          with Kaalsarp dosh must not consider love marriage during the dosh
          period. Doing so will hamper the love you share after marriage, and
          you will have to put extra effort to make things work.

          Karkotak Kaalsarp dosh is responsible for causing hindrance in
          acquiring a fortune. The dosh may also hamper career progress as you
          may witness several hindrances in acquiring a job and getting a
          well-deserved promotion. People dealing with Karkotak Kaalsarp dosh
          also acquire the habit of speaking the truth. This may seem like a
          good thing, but this habit may bar the native from acquiring good
          deals for himself. This doesn't mean that you shouldn't speak the
          truth, but you must surely think before speaking to anyone.

          the Kundli. The good thing about this dosh is that the desires of
          people born in this dosh are usually fulfilled. However, the bad thing
          is that there may be a delay in fulfilling such desires, which may
          leave you frustrated. In the family and home of the native dealing
          with Shankhachur Kaalsarp dosh, there may be a lot of pain and
          suffering. In this period, it is suggested that you focus on your
          family and don't indulge in dealings that you will have to regret in
          the near future.

          native's kundli. When you have this dosha in kundli, it is highly
          recommended that you serve your mother, take care of her and never
          cause her any harm. This will help in bettering your life conditions.
          However, it has been noticed that in return, you may not get the same
          kind of affection from your mother. Due to Ghatak Kaalsarp dosh, the
          person becomes arrogant even if he or she does not have anything to be
          proud of. Your ego is at the top of your head, which may hamper not
