          <h2>Kundli Reading</h2>
          <p>
            Kundli making and Kundli reading in India is one of the ancient
            practices used for predicting one's future and discovery of life
            events. Also called a birth chart or horoscope, a Kundli entails the
            karmic map of the person’s past, present and future events, pictured
            after learning the movement of planets, constellations and much
            more. It is a belief that once a person has the chart of his life
            prepared, it can help him in making better choices in life. Apart
            from this, your Kundli can also give you a picture of your mental,
            emotional, physical and spiritual state of mind and how it would pan
            out as you grow.
          </p>
          <p>
            Moreover, the greatest advantage of Kundli is the fact that it can
            help you understand other people as well. Seek to better understand
            your children? Or your partner? Or your spouse? Well, using their
            Kundli, you can analyse and understand their traits and thereafter
            mould your actions accordingly to fight any incompetency arising
            between you and them.
          </p>
          <p>
            The work of a Kundli is not just limited to detailing a person's
            characteristics or their future. Instead, there are many other
            reasons and situations when and where a Kundli can come in handy.
            Wish to know the luckiest time or luckiest day for you in the whole
            year? You can know that with the help of your kundli. In fact, a
            Kundli can also help you in finding the shubh muhurats for various
            reasons such as marriage, mundan, griha pravesh, etc. You may also
            decide your baby's name as per their Kundli and so much more. In a
            nutshell, a Kundli can help you in many ways, and that is why many
            people also consider learning how to read a Kundli, so they can
            always be slightly aware of what is to come for them ahead. Do you
            wish to learn how to read a kundli? Then stick around to this
            series.

          <h2>Significance and importance of kundli reading</h2>
          <p>
            The significance of Kundli can be asserted from the fact that it is
            one of the first things that most Indian parents consider preparing
            for their child soon after his/her birth. A person’s birth chart is
            prepared after taking into account his date of birth, place of birth
            and time of birth. Based on this information, an astrologer is able
            to find the astrological position of different planets in the
            different houses in Kundli at the time of the child's birth. These
            positions not only define the person's character but also help in
            understanding the effect of various planets on different aspects of
            your life, such as love, marriage, education, career, etc. The
            position of numerous planets in the chart of the person at the time
            of his/her birth also helps in defining their hobbies,
            characteristics, likes, dislikes, etc.

              A person's Kundli doesn't just help him in understanding his

              in finding out doshas and yogas forming in the chart that can
              affect you positively or negatively. For example, the presence or
              absence of Manglik dosha or Gajakesari yoga can be found from your
              kundli.
