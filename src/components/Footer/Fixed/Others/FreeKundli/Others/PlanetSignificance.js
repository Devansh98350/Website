            Planets signs and their significance in astrology
          </h1>
          <h3>Astrology planets and their significance</h3>
          <p>
            In part 3 of how to read kundli, we have studied the significance of
            houses, how to read houses in Kundli and how these houses affect
            one's life. Also, we have learned about planets in astrology.
            However, understanding the nature of planets or signs is still one
            path we need to tread on.
          </p>
          <p>
            So in this post, we are going to learn about the significance of
            each of the planets and signs, their nature and everything you need
            to know about them to learn to read them in a better way.
            Understanding the nature of these planets is vital as it helps in
            understanding how they would generally treat you or leave their
            reflection on you. Also, it helps you learn the traits they rule
            over and much more. So let's get started.
          </p>
          <h3>Planets in astrology and what they mean</h3>
          <p>
            Each planet in astrology has a particular nature and meaning. Also,
            there are certain things that it controls. For example, the planet
            Sun controls the father and also the brain of the individual. Also,
            all the planets have certain colours they favour, an element,
            nature, caste, etc.
          </p>
          <p>
            But you must also know that this nature of planets is subject to
            change when the planet conjuncts with any other planet or sign. For
            example, if Rahu and Ketu conjunct with the most powerful planets
            like Sun and Moon, they not only cause eclipses but may also change
            the nature of Sun and Moon. Then the association of any malefic
            planet can evaporate the good natural results of any planet.
          </p>
          <h3>Sun’s in astrology meaning</h3>
          <p>
            The Sun is known as the soul of all planets. It possesses various

            the world.
          </p>
          <p>
            In astrology, a strong Sun is a significator of energy and
            authority, while a weak Sun can make a person egoistic and less
            confident. You may need a strong Sun when it comes to your career
            and profession, but not when you deal with personal relationships.

          <h3>How to use this information to make a prediction?</h3>
          <p>
            Simply said, you have learned about houses, planets and signs in
            astrology. Now all you need to do is combine all the information you
            have collected to read your kundli for yourself. Then you need to
            find the lord of the house (we have learned that too). Here, number
            11 is written in the 1st house indicating the sign Aquarius and it
            is ruled by Saturn. What this means is that planet Saturn is
            affecting native's looks.
          </p>
          <div className="image-container">
            <img src={image} alt="" className="image" />
          </div>

          <p>
            Now the lord of the 1st house is Saturn but Saturn himself sits in
            some other house. In the chart above, Saturn is positioned in the
            seventh house with Sun and Mercury in the Leo sign (5 = Leo). Sun is
            the lord of Leo too, thus Sun will also affect native's looks.
          </p>
          <p>
            Saturn, as we have learned above, represents the black colour. It
            has the air element to its name. Also, Saturn is denoted by strange
            eyes, thin and tall body, cruel, impotent, thin and tall body.
          </p>
          <p>
            Sun's nature is a square shape, short height, dark red colour, man,
            warrior class, vice, Sattva Guna, fire element.
          </p>
          <p>
            Meaning, the native in question will have the characteristics of
            both these planets.
          </p>
          <p>
            With that being said, here was everything a beginner needed to know
            to learn to read Kundli. Surely, there are many more dimensions to
            kundli reading, but for now, this is what you can get started with.
            All the best.
