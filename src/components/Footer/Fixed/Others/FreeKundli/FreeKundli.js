          <h3>Online Free Kundli For Future Predictions</h3>
          <p>
            The Kundli of a person is one of the most sought aspects of
            astrology. A Kundali entails the details about the positions of
            stars and planets at the time of your birth based on which further
            predictions are made. And with further predictions, we mean
            predictions about different aspects of one's life like love, career,
            health, business, finance, and even marriage. Simply said, Kundli
            making is a necessary thing for any individual and is likely to
            improve their decision-making capabilities gradually in the course
            of time.
          </p>
          <p>
            A Janam Kundli is made after studying the exact position of planets
            at the time you were born and based on the same, one’s Sun sign,
            Moon sign, and other such astrological aspects are listed. The
            Kundali is a co-existence of predictions and charts that help the
            astrologer learn about what your future would be like, the times you
            will have to grind harder, and also the times when luck will be by
            your side in abundance.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, with the culture shift, people are getting very tech-savvy
            and seek things under their thumb. And for the same reason, the
            Janam Kundali making process has also gone online, making it more
            pocket-friendly, accessible, and detailed. We at AstroSwarg, for the
            convenience of the huge user base of ours, provide them with free
            Janam kundali online so anyone and everyone has the luxury of
            learning more about themselves and thus can plan their life better
          </p>
          <p>
            However, we also often bump into people who wonder if this online
            kundali astrology is accurate and if it has the same essence of the
            physical Kundli making process? Or is getting a Kundli made by a
            pandit or Vedic astrologer still the best option? To be honest, a
            Kundli made by a Vedic astrologer surely takes the top spot (which
            our astrologers can make for you), but an online Kundli software is
            no less when it comes to precision. Honestly, an online Kundli can
            be more detailed when compared to the physical ones.
          </p>
          <p>
            To state the obvious, just like a physical Kundli is made by learned
            Vedic astrologers and pandits, similarly, an online Kundli too is
            also prepared as per the astrological predictions by the
            astrologers. What changes is only the medium of sharing that
            information with you, i.e. digital? The digitalisation of Kundli is
            to only allow you more benefits like the availability of information
            in multiple languages.
          </p>
          <p>
            And anyway, one can always get their physical Janam Kundali report
            made by our astrologers, which will reach you physically.
          </p>
          <h3>How To Create a Free Online Janam Kundli?</h3>
          <p>
            Creating an online Kundli for yourself is relatively easy. Honestly,
            butter-easy. All you need to do to make your online Janam Kundli
            with AstroSwarg is simply go to the ‘Kundli’ option and Insert the
            requested information. The requested information would be your date
            of birth, time of your birth, etc. The correct date and time allow
            precise predictions.
          </p>
          <p>
            Once you have filled in the details, all you need to do is click
            submit. Once you click submit, within seconds, you will find a
            detailed Janam Kundli of yourself. Besides textual content (that
            will help you understand what strong or weak traits you have), the
            Janam Kundli will also help you with charts that will showcase the
            position of the different planets in houses based on your current
            astrological situation, which reveals a whole new dimension of
            information.
          </p>
          <p>
            The free Janam Kundli you get on AstroSwarg, though, is made after a
            precise study of all the scientific methods but when it comes to
            writing it down, the study is portrayed in a very simple language so
            you can understand it without any hassle. However, just in case you
            hit a snag or can’t understand what it means, simply chat or ring
            our astrologers to help you with your queries.
          </p>
          <p>
            Besides getting a Janam Kundli for yourself, we also offer Janam
            Kundli matching service to anyone seeking. Janam kundli matching is
            most important when one plans to get married. Matching of kundlis is
            done to ensure the girl and boy planning to get married are
            compatible with each other. This, however, doesn’t mean that if
            kundli doesn't match one shouldn’t marry the other person. But in
            case kundli doesn't match, an astrologer can let you know why it did
            not, and also recommend remedies for the same.
          </p>
          <p>
            Janam Kundli matching is related to Gun matching. Janam Kundli of
            two people, when matched, shows how many guns of those people match.
            Based on this, marriages are fixed. With Janam Kundli matching, you
            can also understand how being Manglik of two people will affect each
            other, what could be the effect of Manglik dosh on you, and remedies
            to get rid of Manglik dosha.
          </p>
          <p>
            These were just a handful of times when Janam Kundli could come in
            handy. So if looking to get one for yourself, get in touch with our
            astrologers for the best advice and service.
          </p>
          <p>

            reading, you can either chat with our astrologer or talk to our
