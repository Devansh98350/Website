          <h2>Astrological Tips To Conceive A Child</h2>
          <p>
            Trying constantly but still finding it hard to conceive a child? Or
            are you the one who is simply looking for some astrological tips for
            childbirth during the pregnancy phase of life? Well, in both the
            cases, you have come to the right place because Astro Swarg brings
            you the best remedies and tips for childbirth as per astrology in
            this blog. However, before you practise any of these for yourself,
            make sure you consult an astrologer about them because although
            these remedies will work fine for you, but at times, some may not
            because of a certain planetary position in your kundli. In such a
            case, an astrologer might tweak the remedy a bit for you to help you
            get the best results.
          </p>
          <p>
            Giving birth to a child is one of the most special moments for a
            couple. Bringing a child home changes a couple’s life altogether and
            is one of the most wondrous feelings to live by. However, at times,
            some couples find it tough to have this happiness for themselves as
            they find it difficult to conceive. Whatever the problem is, not
            being able to have a child when you want to affects all the family
            members equally. Also, the fact that sometimes medication too
            doesn't help in conceiving add to the woes of the couples. However,
            in such instances, astrology can come to your rescue. In fact,
            astrology can also help you throughout the pregnancy phase of your
            life with some astrology tips for pregnancy that would help develop
            a positive environment for both the child and the mother-to-be. So
            having said that, in this blog, we will deep dive into some of the
            best astrological ways to get a child and lighten the stress or
            pregnancy woes for you.
          </p>
          <h2>Child astrology</h2>
          <p>
            The fifth house of astrology is the one that astrologers look at to
            answer all the pregnancy related questions. The fifth house in the
            horoscope represents the child and its related causative elements.
            If the fifth house of a person has a positive combination of
            planets, it helps in ensuring a positive scenario for childbirth.
            Also, the fifth house lord needs to be placed positively in the
            chart of the native to enjoy pregnancy and related aspects of it.
          </p>
          <p>
            Alongside the fifth house, other houses that need to be looked at to
            predict the birth of the child are the 2nd house (house for family)
            and the 11th house (house for gains and fulfilment of desires
            through children). We also see the 9th house as it works only as a
            facilitator.
          </p>
          <p>
            Along with these houses and their respective lords, the planet
            Jupiter too is considered to be the main factor when trying to have
            children. Jupiter in astrology is concerned as the giver planet, and
            its blessing on the native is hence necessary for childbirth.
          </p>
          <p>
            Apart from this, the position of the lord of the ninth house and the
            ninth house itself is analysed through the ascendant horoscope to
            check the possibilities of childbirth for the couple. So if in your
            chart these houses or Jupiter are affected by the malefic
            combinations, then chances of delay in childbirth and pregnancy may
            arise.
          </p>
          <p>
            Apart from these planets, the role of the sixth, eighth and dwadash
            is also prominent. In such a situation, if the guru, i.e. Jupiter is
            debilitated or weak, then it becomes almost impossible for the
            couple to have a child for themselves. Because the fifth house also
            represents the accumulated karmas, in such a situation, happy or
            painful information related to children can be obtained by looking
            at this house.
          </p>
          <p>
            For example, if Saturn, the planet known to cause delay, is
            affecting any of the aforementioned houses or planets, then you may
            have to wait for the birth of your child. In fact, at times, the
            evil effects of Saturn can block the blessings of childbirth for the
            native. Apart from Saturn, malefic Rahu, Ketu and Mars too are the
            creators of hurdles when it comes to childbirth. Rahu and Ketu
            indicate negative deeds related to children. Rahu indicates snake
            defect and loss of fertility. Rahu also creates Pitra Dosh by
            influencing Jupiter, which brings troubles in getting child
            happiness.
          </p>
          <p>
            Having mentioned the reasons for disappointment in having a child,
            we have also got you solutions to fight the negatives or hurdles
            that may come in the way of childbirth for you. Here are some
            astrological remedies for childbirth that can help the couple
            conceive.
          </p>
          <h2>Astrological remedies for child birth</h2>
          <h3>1. Increase the effect of Panchmesh</h3>
          <p>
            Panchmesh in astrology means the fifth house Lord. If Panchmesh is
            afflicted in the Lagna Kundli, then worshipping the Lord can help
            you get rid of its negative effects. But who is the lord of the
            fifth house in astrology, you may ask? Well, for each individual or
            kundli, the lord of the fifth house or any house is different. To
            find who is the Lord of your fifth house, you can either{" "}
            <div className="inline-text">talk to an astrologer</div> or read{" "}
            <div className="inline-text">This blog</div>, which will help you
            find the lords of different houses in your kundli.
          </p>
          <p>
            Apart from the fifth house lord, worshipping Guru or Jupiter is also
            important to get a favourable childbirth outcome. Weak Guru in
            kundli not only hinders child birth but also brings woes during
            pregnancy. So in such a situation, to strengthen the planet Jupiter,
            it is important that you worship it. The best way to please Jupiter
            is to donate jaggery on Thursday. Apart from this, you can also
            narrate any of the below-given mantras to make planet Jupiter
            stronger and favourable in your Kundli.

          <h3>2. Navagraha Puja</h3>
          <p>
            The second remedy for childbirth is to worship Navagrahas or nine
            planets in astrology. The nine planets in astrology represent our
            life and various aspects of it, including childbirth. So if you are
            able to keep all the nine planets in astrology content, they can not
            only help you conceive but also better various other prospects of
            your life. To ensure the planets are in peace, you can start with
            Havan and Abhishek at home or temple.
          </p>
          <p>
            By performing a havan, the negative effects of planets can be
            countered, so as to bring them in lieu with positivity, which will
            give auspicious results to you. This worship will also remove the
            obstacles coming in the birth of children.
          </p>
          <p>
            Apart from everything else, the placement of the Rahu and Ketu in
            the kundli is one of the major indicator obstacles in getting
            children. Rahu and Ketu represent your karma and reward you based on
            the same. However, the fact that your past can’t be changed, hence,
            you can only rectify it by performing certain poojas to please Rahu
            and Ketu. And if you are able to please Rahu and Ketu, then even
            these malefic planets can deliver positive results
          </p>

          <p>
            Apart from the above-mentioned astrological remedies for
            infertility, there are also some God-worship rituals that a native
            can perform to help themselves bring a newborn into the house
            sooner. Worshipping God on a regular basis with a pure heart can
            literally help in solving most of your problems and not being able
            to conceive is just one of them. Having said that, follow the
            below-mentioned worship rituals for Santan prapti or simply during
            pregnancy:

          <UnorderedList>
            <ListItem>
              To start with, Bal Gopal worship is the best way to increase your
              chances of conceiving. Bal Gopal is the childhood form of Lord
              Krishna. Worshipping Krishna removes any impending problem in
              childbirth and can help you in getting yourself a child.
            </ListItem>
            <ListItem>
              The couple can also choose to perform Santan Gopal Puja together.
              Additionally, if you include your family members in the ritual, it
              will work wonders for you.

            <ListItem>
              Skanda Mata Pooja is another important pooja for childbirth.
              Riding on a lion with Lord Kartik in her lap, Skanda Mata is known
              to shower her blessings on her devotees and bless them with
              children. Motherhood happiness is attained by worshipping her. To
              get the blessings of Skanda Mata, chant this mantra-
              <br />
              <p className="red">

          </UnorderedList>
          <h3>4. Eradicate Pitra dosh</h3>
          <p>
            Pitra dosh can also be the reason for infertility in the couple. The
            way you perform other rituals at your home also has a significant
            effect on the possibility of you becoming a parent. So, whenever you
            perform a pooja, make sure there is no hindrance plaguing the same.
            Especially if you haven't performed the last rites of ancestors in
            the correct way, then there may be problems related to children. To
            eradicate the pitra dosh forming due to this, you must perform
            Shradh of ancestors in a systematic manner. Obstacles and obstacles
            related to the birth of children will be removed by performing these
            rituals.
          </p>
          <h3>5. Vastu remedies for childbirth</h3>
          <p>
            The Vastu of the home has an effect on each and every aspect of
            life, with childbirth being no exception. If the vastu of the home
            is negative, numerous problems will exist to hinder your life. These
            problems can be related to your marriage, finance, health,
            professional, childbirth, and much more. Thus it is vital to ensure
            any obstruction in the flow of energy in the house is checked. To do
            the same, the native can perform Vastu Dosh Nivaran Puja using Vastu
            Yantra. With the effect of such poojas, not only will the chances of
            bearing a baby increase for the native, but also there will be a
            boost in other aspects of life such as financial condition, career
            growth, marriage, children and more.
          </p>
          <p>
            Alongside Vastu pooja, a person can also devote time in trying
            certain vastu tips for childbirth or infertility correction. Here

              will help in childbirth.

          <h3>7. Garbh Gauri Rudraksha</h3>
          <p>
            Garbh Gauri Rudraksha represents mother Gauri and her son Shri
            Ganesh. Like Gauri Shankar Rudraksha, Garbh Gauri Rudraksha also has
            two parts. The first part is smaller than the second. Large-sized
            Rudraksha denotes Mata Gaura i.e. Parvati while small-sized
            Rudraksha indicates Lord Ganesha. It is very beneficial for those
            women who are afraid of miscarriage and who are restless to get the
            happiness of motherhood. To get the happiness of a child in life,
            you must wear Garbh Gauri Rudraksha around her neck. According to
            ancient texts, Garbh Gauri Rudraksha is very pure and reeks of
            positive energies. Those women who are unable to conceive or who are
            afraid of miscarriage can wear Garbh Gauri Rudraksha. The same
            Rudraksha is also useful in enhancing the bond between the mother
            and the child. Once you are done installing the Garbh Gauri
            Rudraksha at your place, chant Om Namah Shivaya 108 times to get the
            best of it. We hope that these astrological tips for getting
            children will be beneficial for you.
