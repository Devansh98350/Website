        <Paragraph>
          Trying constantly but still finding it hard to conceive a child? Or
          are you the one who is simply looking for some astrological tips for
          childbirth during the pregnancy phase of life? Well, in both the
          cases, you have come to the right place because Astro Swarg brings you
          the best remedies and tips for childbirth as per astrology in this
          blog. However, before you practise any of these for yourself, make
          sure you consult an astrologer about them because although these
          remedies will work fine for you, but at times, some may not because of
          a certain planetary position in your <RedText>kundli.</RedText> In
          such a case, an astrologer might tweak the remedy a bit for you to
          help you get the best results.
          <br />
          <br />
          Giving birth to a child is one of the most special moments for a
          couple. Bringing a child home changes a couple’s life altogether and
          is one of the most wondrous feelings to live by. However, at times,
          some couples find it tough to have this happiness for themselves as
          they find it difficult to conceive. Whatever the problem is, not being
          able to have a child when you want to affects all the family members
          equally. Also, the fact that sometimes medication too doesn't help in
          conceiving add to the woes of the couples. However, in such instances,
          astrology can come to your rescue. In fact, astrology can also help
          you throughout the pregnancy phase of your life with some astrology
          tips for pregnancy that would help develop a positive environment for
          both the child and the mother-to-be. So having said that, in this
          blog, we will deep dive into some of the best astrological ways to get
          a child and lighten the stress or pregnancy woes for you.
        </Paragraph>
        <Heading3>Child astrology</Heading3>
        <Paragraph>
          The fifth house of astrology is the one that astrologers look at to
          answer all the pregnancy related questions. The fifth house in the
          horoscope represents the child and its related causative elements. If
          the fifth house of a person has a positive combination of planets, it
          helps in ensuring a positive scenario for childbirth. Also, the fifth
          house lord needs to be placed positively in the chart of the native to
          enjoy pregnancy and related aspects of it.
          <br />
          <br />
          Alongside the fifth house, other houses that need to be looked at to
          predict the birth of the child are the 2nd house (house for family)
          and the 11th house (house for gains and fulfilment of desires through
          children). We also see the 9th house as it works only as a
          facilitator.
          <br />
          <br />
          Along with these houses and their respective lords, the planet Jupiter
          too is considered to be the main factor when trying to have children.
          Jupiter in astrology is concerned as the giver planet, and its
          blessing on the native is hence necessary for childbirth.
          <br />
          <br />
          Apart from this, the position of the lord of the ninth house and the
          ninth house itself is analysed through the ascendant horoscope to
          check the possibilities of childbirth for the couple. So if in your
          chart these houses or Jupiter are affected by the malefic
          combinations, then chances of delay in childbirth and pregnancy may
          arise.
          <br />
          <br />
          Apart from these planets, the role of the sixth, eighth and dwadash is
          also prominent. In such a situation, if the guru, i.e. Jupiter is
          debilitated or weak, then it becomes almost impossible for the couple
          to have a child for themselves. Because the fifth house also
          represents the accumulated karmas, in such a situation, happy or
          painful information related to children can be obtained by looking at
          this house.
          <br />
          <br />
          For example, if Saturn, the planet known to cause delay, is affecting
          any of the aforementioned houses or planets, then you may have to wait
          for the birth of your child. In fact, at times, the evil effects of
          Saturn can block the blessings of childbirth for the native. Apart
          from Saturn, malefic Rahu, Ketu and Mars too are the creators of
          hurdles when it comes to childbirth. Rahu and Ketu indicate negative
          deeds related to children. Rahu indicates snake defect and loss of
          fertility. Rahu also creates Pitra Dosh by influencing Jupiter, which
          brings troubles in getting child happiness.
          <br />
          <br />
          Having mentioned the reasons for disappointment in having a child, we
          have also got you solutions to fight the negatives or hurdles that may
          come in the way of childbirth for you. Here are some astrological
          remedies for childbirth that can help the couple conceive.
        </Paragraph>
        <Heading3>Astrological remedies for child birth</Heading3>

        <Heading3>1. Increase the effect of Panchmesh</Heading3>
        <Paragraph>
          Panchmesh in astrology means the fifth house Lord. If Panchmesh is
          afflicted in the Lagna Kundli, then worshipping the Lord can help you
          get rid of its negative effects. But who is the lord of the fifth
          house in astrology, you may ask? Well, for each individual or kundli,
          the lord of the fifth house or any house is different. To find who is
          the Lord of your fifth house, you can either{" "}
          <InlineRedText>talk to an astrologer</InlineRedText> or read{" "}
          <InlineRedText>This blog</InlineRedText>, which will help you find the
          lords of different houses in your kundli.
          <br />
          <br />
          Apart from the fifth house lord, worshipping Guru or Jupiter is also
          important to get a favourable childbirth outcome. Weak Guru in kundli
          not only hinders child birth but also brings woes during pregnancy. So
          in such a situation, to strengthen the planet Jupiter, it is important
          that you worship it. The best way to please Jupiter is to donate
          jaggery on Thursday. Apart from this, you can also narrate any of the
          below-given mantras to make planet Jupiter stronger and favourable in
          your Kundli.

        <Heading3>2. Navagraha Puja</Heading3>
        <Paragraph>
          The second remedy for childbirth is to worship Navagrahas or nine
          planets in astrology. The nine planets in astrology represent our life
          and various aspects of it, including childbirth. So if you are able to
          keep all the nine planets in astrology content, they can not only help
          you conceive but also better various other prospects of your life. To
          ensure the planets are in peace, you can start with Havan and Abhishek
          at home or temple.
          <br />
          <br />
          By performing a havan, the negative effects of planets can be
          countered, so as to bring them in lieu with positivity, which will
          give auspicious results to you. This worship will also remove the
          obstacles coming in the birth of children.
          <br />
          <br />
          Apart from everything else, the placement of the Rahu and Ketu in the
          kundli is one of the major indicator obstacles in getting children.
          Rahu and Ketu represent your karma and reward you based on the same.
          However, the fact that your past can’t be changed, hence, you can only
          rectify it by performing certain poojas to please Rahu and Ketu. And
          if you are able to please Rahu and Ketu, then even these malefic
          planets can deliver positive results

        <Heading3>God worship rituals for santan prapti</Heading3>
        <Paragraph>
          Apart from the above-mentioned astrological remedies for infertility,
          there are also some God-worship rituals that a native can perform to
          help themselves bring a newborn into the house sooner. Worshipping God
          on a regular basis with a pure heart can literally help in solving
          most of your problems and not being able to conceive is just one of
          them. Having said that, follow the below-mentioned worship rituals for
          Santan prapti or simply during pregnancy:
        </Paragraph>
        <UnorderedList>
          <ListItem>
            To start with, Bal Gopal worship is the best way to increase your
            chances of conceiving. Bal Gopal is the childhood form of Lord
            Krishna. Worshipping Krishna removes any impending problem in
            childbirth and can help you in getting yourself a child.
          </ListItem>
          <ListItem>
            The couple can also choose to perform Santan Gopal Puja together.
            Additionally, if you include your family members in the ritual, it
            will work wonders for you.
          </ListItem>

          </ListItem>
          <ListItem>
            Skanda Mata Pooja is another important pooja for childbirth. Riding
            on a lion with Lord Kartik in her lap, Skanda Mata is known to
            shower her blessings on her devotees and bless them with children.
            Motherhood happiness is attained by worshipping her. To get the
            blessings of Skanda Mata, chant this mantra-
            <br />
            <RedText>
              मसांहासनगता तनत्यां पद्माधित करद्वया।शुभदास्तुसदा देवर स्कनदमाता

          </ListItem>
        </UnorderedList>
        <Heading3>4. Eradicate Pitra dosh</Heading3>
        <Paragraph>
          Pitra dosh can also be the reason for infertility in the couple. The
          way you perform other rituals at your home also has a significant
          effect on the possibility of you becoming a parent. So, whenever you
          perform a pooja, make sure there is no hindrance plaguing the same.
          Especially if you haven't performed the last rites of ancestors in the
          correct way, then there may be problems related to children. To
          eradicate the pitra dosh forming due to this, you must perform Shradh
          of ancestors in a systematic manner. Obstacles and obstacles related
          to the birth of children will be removed by performing these rituals.
        </Paragraph>
        <Heading3>5. Vastu remedies for childbirth</Heading3>
        <Paragraph>
          The Vastu of the home has an effect on each and every aspect of life,
          with childbirth being no exception. If the vastu of the home is
          negative, numerous problems will exist to hinder your life. These
          problems can be related to your marriage, finance, health,
          professional, childbirth, and much more. Thus it is vital to ensure
          any obstruction in the flow of energy in the house is checked. To do
          the same, the native can perform Vastu Dosh Nivaran Puja using Vastu
          Yantra. With the effect of such poojas, not only will the chances of
          bearing a baby increase for the native, but also there will be a boost
          in other aspects of life such as financial condition, career growth,
          marriage, children and more.
          <br />
          <br />
          Alongside Vastu pooja, a person can also devote time in trying certain
          vastu tips for childbirth or infertility correction. Here are Vastu
          tips for pregnancy and to enhance fertility

          Although we are recommending you auspicious gemstones to wear for
          childbirth, but you must not wear them without proper guidance from an
          astrologer. These crystals surely do help in resolving any kind of

          based on your kundli. Thus proper guidance is necessary before wearing

        <Heading3>7. Garbh Gauri Rudraksha</Heading3>
        <Paragraph>
          Garbh Gauri Rudraksha represents mother Gauri and her son Shri Ganesh.
          Like Gauri Shankar Rudraksha, Garbh Gauri Rudraksha also has two
          parts. The first part is smaller than the second. Large-sized
          Rudraksha denotes Mata Gaura i.e. Parvati while small-sized Rudraksha
          indicates Lord Ganesha. It is very beneficial for those women who are
          afraid of miscarriage and who are restless to get the happiness of
          motherhood. To get the happiness of a child in life, you must wear
          Garbh Gauri Rudraksha around her neck. According to ancient texts,
