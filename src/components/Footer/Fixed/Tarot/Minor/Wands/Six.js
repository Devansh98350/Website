          <h3>Six of Wands Tarot Card Description</h3>
          <p>
            The image on the card of Six of Wands depicts a man wearing a
            garland around his head, representing his triumph. He can be seen
            riding a horse amongst people, who are also cheering and applauding
            him. As we notice closer, we see that the horse that the man is
            riding is white, and the colour white is a symbol of purity,
            strength, and victory. The crowd around the man is a good
            representation of the support and appreciation of the public and
            other close people around him.
          </p>
          <p>
            The man is also holding and probably waving a wand in his hand,
            which is also adorned with garlands and wreaths, further symbolising
            his success and victory. The man is proud of his achievements, as he
            is not shy around the people and is confidently flaunting himself.
            Seeing his confidence, the crowd gets more excited and cheers him
            with more enthusiasm.
          </p>

          <h2>Six of Wands (Upright)</h2>
          <h3>Upright Six of Wands Meaning</h3>
          <p>
            Six of Wands represent victory, fame, and triumph. This card
            indicates that you have successfully achieved everything that you
            have ever desired, and because of that you are getting the
            recognition, which you truly deserve. Because of your results, you
            are being publicly acknowledged and becoming the recipient of fame.
            This card signifies that you have or you will soon receive a form of
            award or something equivalent to it due to your success.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Six of Wands is a great sign that tells you that you were
            working on yourself for a while now and finally have gained the
            inner or outer strength which you needed to get the success. The
            confusion which was indicated by the five of wands previously, with
            the appearance of this card, you have managed to get rid of the
            confusion and have started to focus on your goals and achievements.
          </p>
          <p>
            One should be careful when this card appears, as along with an
            indication of success, it also brings overconfidence and egotistical
            behaviour. Even if you have successfully achieved everything that
            you desired and made a name for yourself, make sure to stay grounded
            and humble as the prior can hurt your reputation.
          </p>

            you were interested in is now looking at you in a new way and is
            more receptive to you. You just need to take the initiative now to
            let them know your feelings towards them.
          </p>
          <p>
            Those who are in a long-distance relationship, or a relationship in
            general, and we're working together for something, like moving in
            together or moving to a city to be closer, your plans are about to
            come to fruition. All around, the six of wands upright mean good
            news and happiness in the relationship, for now, and for the future.

            have been working very hard for a long time now, and your dedication

            would be there too. However, for abundance to be regular in your
            life, you would have to manage your money well and value it at all
            cost.
          </p>

            important or reached a goal you had set faster than you anticipated,
            which is a positive thing for your work. You are proud of yourself,
            and so are your seniors and colleagues, because of which you can

            turn of your profession, you will encounter positive results and
            outcomes that are in your favour. Enjoy being successful and
            confident, but don't let this get to your head. Try being
            down-to-earth and humble and celebrate previous conflicts being
            ended.
          </p>

          <h3>Health (Upright)</h3>

            good omen for health. If you have been fighting an illness for a
            long time, and are currently going through treatment, very soon you

            Physically you will feel strong and healthy, and this will help you
            immensely to focus on work and your family. It is also an indication
            of you getting back to the field if you are in sports and couldn't
            perform because of your health.
          </p>
          <p>

          <h2>Six of Wands (Reversed)</h2>
          <h3>Reversed Six of Wands Tarot Card Meaning</h3>
          <p>
            If the Six of Wands appear reversed, this is an indication that you
            are having a crisis in your life and are not feeling confident at
            all. All your time is being spent self-doubting every decision you
            ever made and worrying about failing yourself along with those close
            to you. You are constantly scared that you are being a
            disappointment to everyone and this is causing stress and anxiety.
            An aura of negativity has surrounded you and made you doubt your
            abilities to achieve anything in life.
          </p>
          <p>
            Six of wands reversed also means not getting recognition for the
            work you have done, and this is stopping you from getting motivated.
            This minor arcana card represents mob mentality. This means because
            of your self-doubt, you don't trust yourself right now and you are
            ready to do what the person in front of you is doing without much
            evaluation. Because of low motivation, your creativity has gotten
            dry and you find that you have no other choice but to follow and
            copy what others are doing. You might also get backstabbed by
            someone close to you. So keep your ears and eyes open.
          </p>
          <p>
            Treachery is also an indication of the Six of Wands being reversed.
            It is suggested that you spend time with your friends whom you trust
            completely or close family members, and confess your worries and
            issues. This is going to help you a lot as they will show you how
            important and talented you are. Spending time with them will also
            uplift your mood.
          </p>

          <h3>Love and Relationships (Reversed)</h3>
          <p>
            In a love and relationship reading, the six of wands reversed to
            mean that you are not very confident about yourself right now, and
            this is affecting your relationship. Maybe you are feeling that the
            love that you deserve, you are not receiving, or your efforts are
            going under appreciated because of which your confidence level is
            getting low.
          </p>
          <p>
            People around you are getting more recognition and success even with
            the least amount of effort. Don't let these incidents change your
            attitude towards the world and make you bitter about everything.
            Know that your positivity and goodness are what attract people the
            most, and negativity always repels good people.
          </p>

          <h3>Finances (Reversed)</h3>
          <p>
            The appearance of the six of wands reversed means that you must
            evaluate and assess your finances. You might have noticed that
            recently there has been a decrease in income or savings. This
            indication could be about a single event, such as an investment that
            you have made that might not bring much revenue or buying something
            that did not end up to your liking, or it could mean about the whole
            financial situation.
          </p>
          <p>
            If it's later, and you have not made any investment lately then it
            can mean that your income is decreasing gradually without you
            noticing. Even if the situation might not get extremely adverse, it
            sure will be a tough time to go through. Also, six of wands reversed
            represents low confidence, which means that you will not have much
            confidence in your financial situation to improve. Keep working hard
            diligently and be proactive about your finances.
          </p>

          <h3>Career (Reversed)</h3>
          <p>
            Mostly everything gets reversed with the reversal of the six of
            wands, and this includes your career and profession as well. Where
            you would have expected success and wealth if the card appeared
            upright, with the reversed card chances are that your career may
            have to take a few hits during these times. Projects that you were
            working on might end up being a flop, and this is hurting your
            confidence and ambition.
          </p>
          <p>
            You must have been passed over for a better position at work or a
            raise or if you were in any form of conflict at your office, chances
            are that they did not end up in your favour. The Six of Wands
            reversed can also be an indication of your general feelings towards
            your current work, which are loaded with boredom and zero
            motivation. Because of the lack of motivation, you are just not able
            to tap into your creativity which in result delaying all your
            projects and work.
          </p>

          <h3>Health (Reversed)</h3>
          <p>
            Six of wands reversed is not a good sign for a healthy tarot reading
            as it can be interpreted as degrading health, both physically and
            mentally. This card should be taken as a warning that some old
            wounds are going to bother you again. Maybe you had an illness that
            required a lot of special attention or maybe you had an ailment
            which got cured but is re-appearing again. The Six of Wands
            (reversed) says that its time to look after yourself again and
            believe in the process of healing and understanding.
          </p>
          <p>
            You have been given the clear and you were doing fine all this time.
            But this card is indicating that you might have to go through a
            relapse, and have to start treatment again, which will be extra
            stressful for you. If you are in the sports field as your career,
            disappointment could haunt you as you might get injured or your
            return from a break is not turning up into good results.
          </p>

          <h2>Six of Wands: One Card Pull</h2>
          <p>
            One card pull is done when you want to have straight to the point
            and quick answers. It is for the time when you wish to know specific
            answers in the form of Yes or No. So, if you are going through any
            tough situation or stuck in a dilemma, getting a one card pull is
            always helpful. Post shuffling the card, you can choose one from the
            deck. Depending on your question, you shall get the answer to the
            question. The results for one card pull in the six of wands card is:
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Upright Position:</strong> If you have pulled the six of
            wands upright, rest assured as the answer is a yes in every angle
            and your desired wish is soon going to come true.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Reversed Position:</strong> If you pull the six of wands
            reversed, the answer is still yes, although it won't be that easy to
            get your wish fulfilled and you will have to work harder and get rid
            of your overconfidence.
          </p>

          <h2>Six of Wands Card for Timing</h2>
          <p>
            If the question is about the exact time when something you are
            wishing for will come to reality, and the six of wands has been
            pulled out, this can indicate that the time is very near. To be very
            specific about the time, one should expect it to be during the
            spring, or zodiac sign season Aries, Sagittarius or Leo.
          </p>
          <p>
            In numbers if one wants to count, they should expect the time to be
            one month later, or specifically 6th, 15th, 24th or the upcoming
            month.
          </p>
          <p>
            Keep in mind that whatever you are wishing for is right around the
            corner and needs just a bit of patience. You will soon figure out
            the time. If the reading is done during the summer season, this does
            not mean that your wish will be fulfilled during the spring. It
            means that you should expect the time to be during the Leo season or
            the upcoming month.
          </p>
          <p>
            It could also be interpreted by taking the number of the card. And
            in this case the number is six, so you should expect it to be during
            the 6th day, 6th week or 6th month of the reading. It is hard to
            predict the future taking into consideration years since our future
            keeps changing by every action we take.
