            represent relaxation, unity, and community success. A time of

          <p>
            This card depicts a couple with flowers in their hands, dancing
            underneath a wreath of beautiful flowers and leaves that are adorned
            by tall wands, which have crystal tips. These wands are identical
            and spread equally in the background. The canopy of flowers is
            identical to the flower arrangements that we see at Jewish
            ceremonies. The couple has their hands raised as if celebrating for
            the recent victory they achieved. They are dancing very close to one
            another, hinting that they have a close relationship.
          </p>
          <p>
            The people in the background are also seen to be celebrating with
            them, indicating the importance of connecting with others. All of
            these symbols show that time has a sense of fulfilment, a time for
            celebrating the attainment of success.

          </p>

          <h2>Four of Wands (Reversed)</h2>
          <h3>Reversed Four of Wands Tarot Card Meaning</h3>
          <p>
            While four of wands upright represent family reunion and community
            spirit, Four of Wands reversed represent everything opposite it.
            When this card appears reversed, this indicates that you are feeling
            a sense of loneliness and left out. There is a lack of harmony and
            unity among your family members, which is very apparent from the
            heavy atmosphere, and you are finding it very uncomfortable to spend
            time with your family members. There is tension between the family
            members and your friends as you are not able to fit in with them.
            You are feeling as if you have no support from them and that feeling
            is dragging your mood down. This card indicates that you must have
            achieved something very special and you wanted to share your
            feelings of satisfaction and fulfilment with your loved ones, but
            you are not receiving the reaction that you expected from them. They
            do not want to celebrate your success.
          </p>
          <p>
            The reversed Four of Wands are also highly significant for cancelled
            events or parties. Maybe you were responsible for arranging the
            wedding ceremony of a close one, or a surprise party, but
            unfortunately, the event got cancelled, and this is giving you a
            feeling of destitution. This minor arcana card indicates that you
            are planning to go home after a long period, but due to unforeseen
            issues, you had to cancel the plan. This card, when reversed, also
            represents failure. Maybe you were working on a very important
            project, and a lot was at stake because of this project. But because
            of a lack of planning or support from others around you, this
            project turned out to be a failure, which has devastated you.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Four of Wands (reversed) are an indication of neglect and
            desolation. Lack of success and achievements are hinted at by this
            minor arcana card when reversed. You might be feeling a sense of
            self-doubt or having very low self-esteem because of the failures
            that you had to go through, or that you are not receiving the
            support from your close ones like you expected. This card also
            symbolises that there is no teamwork or trust among the people you
            are working with or associated with.
          </p>

          <h3>Love and Relationships (Reversed)</h3>
          <p>
            If the Four of Wands appear reversed, this is not a good sign as
            things are going to get difficult, if you are in a relationship.
            This card reversal represents all the negative things that one can
            think of for a relationship. This card indicates a lack of harmony,
            unhappiness from family and close ones, unstable relationships, and
            failure of relationships. If this card appears, this means that the
            chances of disputes and misunderstanding is high in your
            relationship. Maybe due to miscommunication or misunderstanding, you
            and your partner are going to feel as if you are not compatible with
            one another anymore.
          </p>
          <p>
            Insecurity is also a reason why the relationship might turn bitter.
            The appearance of this card means that some incidents might change
            your relationship forever, indicating tough and unpredictable times.
            The reversed position of this can hint that a celebration or
            ceremony is going to get cancelled and this will bring conflict
            between your family members, which will divide them. Maybe, your
            relationship with your partner is not accepted by your family or
            theirs, because of which you are feeling desolate and miserable.
          </p>
          <p>
            You wanted your family to support you. A wedding ceremony is also
            going to get postponed or cancelled, meaning if you were hoping to
            tie the knot with your partner, chances are that you are going to
            face disappointment. You might be feeling like you do not fit in
            within any social circle around you, and it makes you feel left out
            and alone if you are single. If you were hoping to get back with
            your ex, this Minor Arcana card is giving you signals that it is not
            the best idea.
          </p>

          <h3>Finances (Reversed)</h3>
          <p>
            Your financial situation is not in favour of the Four of Wands
            (Reversed). You are or you will become the victim of poor economic
            conditions and most of its cause will be your relationships. Your
            family responsibilities are becoming too much for you to handle and
            are weighing you down. Spending too much money for the sake of your
            family is making a big dent in your bank account, so much so that
            even making ends meet is becoming hard for you.
          </p>
          <p>
            You should be careful when you have to spend money on these
            unforeseen expenditures. Try to evaluate the situation and your
            financial situation thoroughly before lending money to your family
            or friends. Make sure that you are providing for those only who need
            your support and help. Do not give away your hard-earned money to
            everyone just because of their desires and not because of their
            need, even if they are very close people.
          </p>

          <h3>Career (Reversed)</h3>
          <p>
            You are going to see the opposite reaction to this card is upright.
            As in Four of Wands tarot card being upright meant work-life
            flourishing, the same card reversed means that things are not easy
            for you at your workplace. You are finding it extremely hard to
            create friendships and bonds with your colleagues and your
            relationship is in strain. This could indicate the general mood or
            energy of your workplace or could refer to a specific incident that
            became the reason behind this tension in the air.
          </p>
          <p>
            Chances are that, if you or someone else is planning for an office
            event, it will get cancelled or not go as planned. You have been
            trying to build a good relationship with your colleagues, but
            everything is going the other way, ruining whatever was already
            there. It could also mean that the environment of your workplace is
            harsh and unfriendly in general and this is taking a toll on your
            mental health.
          </p>

          <h3>Health (Reversed)</h3>
          <p>
            Be careful if the Four of Wands tarot card appear in reversed
            positions, in terms of health. Your health is going to deteriorate
            and you have to suffer from illness. This card indicates that you
            are too involved with your work and your family's needs, that you
            have forgotten about your health and happiness.
          </p>
          <p>
            You have forgotten to stop and think about what you like or take
            part in an activity that you love. Chances are that you will become
            the victim of a serious illness, because of which you might have to
            get hospitalised or need the assistance of your family members to
            help you recover from this illness and get back to work.
          </p>
