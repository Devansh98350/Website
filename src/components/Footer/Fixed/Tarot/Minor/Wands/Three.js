          <h3>Three of Wands Tarot Card Description</h3>
          <p>
            The Three of Wands shows a man standing at the edge of a cliff,
            looking beyond the sea and mountains. He has left the comfort of his
            castle, as viewed in the Two of Wands, and has come out to explore.
            He is ready for the upcoming adventures that the unknown world has
            to offer, just to find his true self.
          </p>
          <p>
            We see three wands, standing upright and steady on the ground around
            him. They are the symbol of everything that he has planned so far,
            his promises on how to execute the plans, and his firm belief in
            himself. He is holding on to one of the wands, looking forward, as
            he is ready to take the first step, to move forward with his plans.
          </p>

          <h2>Three of Wands (Upright)</h2>
          <h3>Upright Three of Wands Tarot Card Meaning</h3>
          <p>
            The Three of Wands coming upright means that you have planned your
            future, or are thinking of planning your future with more belief and
            conviction. This card indicates that you are happy with how things
            are going right now or that your plans are turning out to be
            fruitful. It also means that you are ready to take action and move
            forward with your plans. You are working to create a stable ground
            for your future.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Three of Wands symbolizes the occurrence of opportunities, which
            you are going to appreciate a lot since these opportunities are
            going to widen and broaden your experience in life. This card hints
            that you should let go of prejudice and your comfort zone, and
            accept unknown things since these unknown happenings are going to
            turn out to be opportunities for a better future. As you are moving
            towards your plans, you are also coming across more opportunities
            that are going to help you more for a better future, although you
            have to step out of your comfort zone and try things you wouldn't
            usually do.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Three of Wands represents that you are the one who is in control
            of your own life and future, similar to the man in the card, who is
            standing tall and looking towards the sea and the mountains, with
            his head held high. Even if you are about to venture into the
            unknown, you are confident with your capabilities and believe that
            you will get through everything that the world has to offer. You
            have a strong position in this world.
          </p>

          <h3>Love and Relationships (Upright)</h3>
          <p>
            In a love and relationship reading, Three of Wands appearing upright
            means that you are about to step into the next phase of your
            romantic relationship. You and your partner are now thinking about
            your future and seeing each other in them. This card hints that you
            need to be more assertive about your commitments to the relationship
            to make it a lasting one if you have stepped into a new
            relationship. If you are already in a serious relationship for a
            while, this card indicates that it is the right time to set goals
            for your future, together as a couple, and work together to achieve
            these goals.
          </p>
          <p>
            Keep the communication going. Talk about what you want out of life,
            how you see this relationship going if you see yourself getting
            married to your partner, and if yes how soon. You and your partner
            are going to soon talk about moving in together, and this will make
            your bond stronger than before. This upright tarot card suggests
            that, as you are taking your relationship to the next level, make
            sure to communicate about the smallest of things, of what you like
            and what is being an inconvenience. This way the transition will be
            much smoother, without any disputes.
          </p>

          <h3>Finances (Upright)</h3>
          <p>
            The Three of Wands, when appearing upright, indicates a time of
            leisure and living life. You have been putting a lot of effort into
            building your career and settling a stable bank account balance. Now
            is the time when you reap the fruits of your hard work. Your hours
            of labour are now paying off. With your hard-earned money, it is
            suggested that you give yourself a much-deserved break. Don't be shy
            to spend some money on a vacation.
          </p>
          <p>
            If it's required, don't fret about investing to take your business
            further, because these investments are going to turn up positive
            results. If there is any course you want to take or an educational
            trip that you have always wanted to go to, but were hesitant about
            because of your financial situation, the appearance of this card
            hints that you should just bite the bullet and do what your heart
            desires.
          </p>

          <h3>Career (Upright)</h3>
          <p>
            Three of Wands (Upright) in a tarot reading means you are going to
            encounter new and wonderful things throughout the time. A new
            adventure and opportunity await you in every aspect of life. This
            applies to your career as well. From now on, you are going to come
            across any new opportunities and chances that are going to impact
            your career in the best way possible. These new opportunities are
            going to push you beyond your limits, and you are going to try out
            things that you wouldn't normally have for the sake of your future.
          </p>
          <p>
            This way, these new adventures are shaping you into the person that
            you always thought you were but were hesitant to let out. This can
            mean new job opportunities that let you travel overseas, or your
            business expanding beyond your own country and reaching the foreign
            lands, and becoming global.
          </p>

          <h3>Health (Upright)</h3>
          <p>
            The meaning of this card, in terms of health, signifies recovery
            from a long-term illness. If you have been suffering from a physical
            ailment for a long time, this card means that you are finally going
            to be free from it. This also means that you must have had a
            treatment or surgery, and from now on you will start to recover and
            live life normally. Since Three of Wands strongly suggests
            travelling, this could mean that you might have to go out of your
            country to get treatment, or you might need to get vaccinated to
            live abroad for a while.
          </p>

          <h2>Three of Wands (Reversed)</h2>
          <h3>Reversed Three of Wands Tarot Card Meaning</h3>
          <p>
            The Three of Wands, when it comes up reversed, means that you have
            been working hard for your future and have been on a journey to
            expand your life experience, but things are not going as you
            planned. The things that you wanted to achieve are not coming into
            your grasp. There are many obstacles and blockages that have been
            keeping you from your desired outcomes, but this card tries to teach
            you that, even if your hard work is going to waste sometimes, it is
            still not all useless, as they are working to build up your
            endurance and make you strong.
          </p>
          <p>
            When the Three of Wands comes up reversed, it means that the time to
            think about your future and make plans to establish your place in
            this world has come. You have been too busy wandering about,
            idealising others' shining life, that your own life has gone
            unnoticed. It could also mean that you do not yet know what you want
            out of life, or that your current lifestyle is making you feel
            overwhelmed, and stressing your brain so much that you do not have
            the energy to think or plan for your own life ahead.
          </p>
          <p>
            The most important life lesson the Three of Wands gives you is to
            keep working for the life you want. And if things aren't going the
            way you envisioned, change your path and course of action. Look for
            your desired result somewhere else, if that's necessary. The man in
            the card is shown to be looking out at the world, always in search
            of a new opportunity.
          </p>

          <h3>Love and Relationships (Reversed)</h3>
          <p>
            This card comes up reversed indicating that your relationship has a
            lack of communication, and it's more or less your fault. It may be
            hard to confess things that are hard to share, or things your
            partner is doing that are bothering you. It's hard to let your true
            feelings show, afraid that what if that upsets your partner or what
            if they don't appreciate your openness. But this is going to harm
            the relationship more than it will do good. Chances of
            miscommunication or misunderstanding are more if you don't talk
            about what you like or don't like. Try to talk about everything and
            sort out any problems before they get out of hand.
          </p>
          <p>
            Especially, if you are in a new relationship, you might find it a
            bit difficult to adjust to this transition from being single to
            being in a relationship, but know that even if you are dating your
            soulmate, not everything will go smoothly if you don't put in the
            effort. You need to be there for your relationship to work and be
            patient. Also, do not force your ideas on your partner because that
            is how you think a partner should be. This is going to turn them off
            and make them make distance with you.
          </p>

          <h3>Finances (Reversed)</h3>
          <p>
            If the Three of Wands appears reversed, this means that you are
            going to be in financial chaos for a while. This doesn't imply that
            you are going to become bankrupt or are going to have a lot of
            losses. It just means that you must have invested a huge amount of
            money for a business or any professional aspect for a while now, but
            are not getting back the desired outcome yet, and it's just taking
            too long. It could mean that you do not evaluate every minor detail
            or outcome before investing, and that is what causes the delay.
          </p>
          <p>
            This card advises you to calculate all your finances, and keep a
            good stock of how much money is going out and how much is coming in.
            Be more diligent towards your hard-earned money as you work for your
            career, and this will help you avoid any major losses.
          </p>

          <h3>Career (Reversed)</h3>
          <p>
            In terms of your career, this card in a reversed position might
            indicate that you are frustrated with your current situation and are
            regretting some of the decisions you must have made in the past.
            Three of Wands in the tarot deck means that you must have had job
            proposals before, but you rejected them, for reasons like you were
            busy or engaged with some other responsibilities.
          </p>
          <p>
            You wanted to try out these interesting and new jobs and explore new
            careers or have a chance to go abroad, but you were too boxed in,
            which led you to let this opportunity go. You regret this very much
            and that is making you frustrated with your current job. If that is
            not the case, the reason behind the frustration could be that you
            are trying very hard to give your career flight, but for some reason
            or the other, you are just able to reach your desired goal.
          </p>

          <h3>Health (Reversed)</h3>
          <p>
            In the tarot reading, Three of Wands reversed can mean different
            things in terms of health. Since travelling is very heavily
            suggested by this card, it could mean that maybe you have plans of
            going abroad and chances are that you are going to catch a foreign
            illness which is going to become a very stressful situation for you.
            It is suggested that you should prepare proper insurance when you
            are travelling, so the stress is reduced.
          </p>
          <p>
            Take proper precautions as you are abroad, such as taking care of
            what you eat, getting vaccinated, or using proper mosquito repellent
            to avoid illness as much as possible. The Three of Wands also
            represents that you are going through an illness for a long time,
            but it is frustrating you as the treatment is taking too long and
            you want to live normally as soon as possible.
          </p>

          <h2>Three of Wands: One Card Pull</h2>
          <p>
            One card pull is done when you want to have straight to the point
            and quick answers. It is for the time when you wish to know specific
            answers in the form of Yes or No. So, if you are going through any
            tough situation or are stuck in a dilemma, getting a one-card pull
            is always helpful. Post shuffling the card, you can choose one from
            the deck. Depending on your question, you shall get the answer to
            the question. The results for one card pull in the Three of Wands
            card is:
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Upright Position:</strong> If you pull the Three of Wands in
            an upright position, the answer is yes, but you will achieve your
            desired result after putting in effort and hard work.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Reversed Position:</strong> If you pull the Three of Wands
            in the reversed position, the answer is still yes, but you have to
            communicate openly about what you want and reach a conclusion that
            satisfies everyone involved.
          </p>

          <h2>Three of Wands Card for Timing</h2>
          <p>
            If you want to know when a specific thing is going to happen, and
            you pull out the Three of Wands, the time is not far for your desire
            to get fulfilled. The time will be counted in days or months, as in
            one month later or around the 3rd, 12th, or 21st of the next month.
            No matter the exact date, this Minor Arcana card indicates that
            whatever you are praying for will reach you very soon.
          </p>
          <p>
            Spring here doesn't mean that if you are doing the reading in the
            summer, so your desired wish will be fulfilled the next spring. It
            depicts that what you want will arrive at you the next month from
            the date of the reading.
          </p>
          <p>
            An easier way to interpret the time is to take note of the number of
            the card. Here it is three in the Three of Wands, which means that
            your time is in 3 days, 3 weeks, or 3 months. It is hard to predict
            the future in years through tarot card reading or any other form of
            spiritual reading, as our future frequently changes with every
            action and choice we make in our life.
