          <h3>Eight of Wands Tarot Card Description</h3>
          <p>
            The illustration of the eight of wands in the Rider-Waite tarot card
            doesn't match the exact energy of the card itself. The image in the
            card is not very complicated and suggests that 'many things are up
            in the air, or simply in the process. It shows eight staves, which
            have a similar look to wands, suspended in the air. We can see that
            the wands look like they are blossoming and someone must have thrown
            them in the air as they look like they are travelling at a high
            speed.
          </p>
          <p>
            The background has a clear blue sky with nothing in their path,
            which can be interpreted as there is nothing in their path that will
            stop them or be an obstacle in their journey to their destination.
            Unlike most Minor Arcana cards, Eight of Wands do not have people in
            them, which is a unique aspect of the card. The meaning of the card
            is depicted only through the flying sticks sailing through the clear
            sky. Other than the wands, we can notice some mountains and rivers,
            but their placement holds very less meaning.
          </p>
          <p>
            The flowing water of the river can be interpreted as a source of
            life and energy for the card. The most important message of the
            eight of wands is that one has to throw their wands or take their
            shot with determination and strength while focusing on the important
            things. The eight of wands are of the fire element and the zodiac
            signs that are associated with this card are Aries, Leo, and
            Sagittarius.
          </p>

          <h2>Eight of Wands (Upright)</h2>
          <h3>Upright Eight of Wands Meaning</h3>
          <p>
            The Eight of Wands upright tells us that all the struggles and
            hardships that were indicated by the seven of wands have now ended,
            and a time of freedom and independence to move forward with your
            plans has come. This card has a lot of energy stored in them which,
            when it appears upright, forces you to move forward with your plans
            and reach your goals faster than ever. It indicates that your life
            is about to get busy and you won't have much time on your hands,
            because you will be working hard with dedication for your future and
            making immense progress.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Eight of Wands (upright) tarot card urges you to not be very
            sceptical and biassed, and just go with the flow. Things will fall
            into the right place themselves. Things are moving fast now, so
            starting with your plans as fast as possible and making good use of
            this fast momentum will be very beneficial for you. The energy of
            the universe is about to surround you, which if you put it to good
            use, will propel you forward, giving you a head start in your
            journey. Even if you feel unsure or unprepared, don't slow the
            process as you will lose the opportunity that you have been given by
            the universe. Use the energy to prepare yourself and invest it to
            bring positive changes and bring out positive results.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Eight of Wands in the upright position are also an indicator of
            incoming news that is going to be very important for you. This can
            mean that good news is about to come which will skyrocket your plans
            for the future and you will experience steady growth. It means that
            you have been waiting for a decision that will have a huge impact on
            your life, and soon you will receive that decision. Do not grow
            impatient and just wait for it.
          </p>

          <h3>Love and Relationships (Upright)</h3>
          <p>
            In terms of relationship, if the eight of wands appear upright, this
            indicates that you will receive new found spark and happiness in
            your relationship. Your relationship with your partner was going a
            little stale in comparison to how it was at the beginning. You were
            struggling to find the connection you had previously which was
            making you and your partner standoffish and distanced. But the
            appearance of this card indicates that the spark and connection will
            return, and your relationship will go back to how it was. If you
            haven't been in a relationship for a while, and your love life seems
            to be going nowhere, this card indicates that soon you will find a
            very compatible person whose company you will enjoy the most.
          </p>
          <p>
            You will soon be feeling the tumultuous emotions of being in love
            and your relationship will seem to be moving fast. Make sure to make
            good use of this sudden surge of energies and don't let any
            opportunity go through your hand. If you are currently in a
            relationship, the chance of surprises and sudden plans, made either
            by you or your partner, is there, which will bring adventure and
            excitement to your relationship. Know that these surprises are good
            and positive which will make your bond stronger and help it last
            longer.
          </p>

          <h3>Finances (Upright)</h3>
          <p>
            The force and speed at which the wands appear to be in the card of
            eight of wands apply to your financial situation. As the wands seem
            to be travelling with a speed, money is going to be a fleeting thing
            for you right now, and as fast as you are receiving money, you will
            be prone to losing them just as fast during this time. Although this
            is not a particularly bad thing it depends on how you utilise this
            time and energy. You have to be very careful about where your money
            is getting invested or the reasons for expenditure.
          </p>
          <p>
            Try to keep account of how much is coming in and how much is going
            out. This card indicates that you will be extremely tempted to make
            some expenses that with more evaluation will seem very unnecessary.
            So be careful with useless purchases and keep your hands tied during
            these times because things might become difficult if you do not
            control your impulses.
          </p>

          <h3>Career (Upright)</h3>
          <p>
            The eight of wands represent quick movements. This is applied to
            your career and can have a literal or figurative meaning. If this
            card appears, this hints to you about a business trip you are about
            to take shortly. But if that is not the case, then the eight of
            wands is resonating with your internal feeling of satisfaction and
            success as you are feeling you are making great progress in your
            career and profession and you are moving forward very fast. You are
            having this feeling that you are achieving the progress you desired
            faster than you anticipated.
          </p>
          <p>
            This positive energy is making you feel like you are finally able to
            burst out of your shell and are making the progress that you always
            wanted. The eight of wands also indicate that you are probably
            making plans for the future and taking account of your resources
            which you will soon use to pursue your dreams. You are right now
            working on getting your life in order, and taking care of your
            mental and physical health, to keep yourself in an excellent
            position when you work on your goals.
          </p>

          <h3>Health (Upright)</h3>
          <p>
            In terms of health-related reading, the eight of wands in the
            upright position are mostly good news as it indicates good health
            and active physicality. This card indicates that you will be able to
            get rid of your illness very quickly, without delay or struggle.
            This card means rapid recovery from injury or illness.
          </p>
          <p>
            It also indicates that you will most probably have very good health
            and will be physically active during this time, which will help you
            to be very involved and attentive in your profession and life.
            Although, the eight of wands in some cases also mean emergency
            medical attention. Chances are that you might get an injury from a
            sport or other physically active task which will require special and
            quick attention. But the recovery from that injury will be just as
            fast.
          </p>

          <h2>Eight of Wands (Reversed)</h2>
          <h3>Reversed Eight of Wands Tarot Card Meaning</h3>
          <p>
            When the Eight of Wands appear reversed, you should take it as a
            warning sign as it tells you to do some more contemplating before
            moving forward. You must be moving forward with a plan which you
            have made already, but this card is an indication that there might
            be some disputes or misplaced research in your plan, which later on
            could seriously harm your plan. It's great that you are being
            assertive with your decisions, but slow down a bit, relax and give a
            few more thoughts before moving forward. Being hasty will hurt you
            in great ways. Or it could be that you are rushing into plans that
            do not hold much meaning, instead of doing important things.
          </p>
          <p>
            This card warns you about fleeting determination because you are
            prone to get attracted to things or ideas that are new, completely
            forgetting about the plan you were working on previously, and
            switching focus immediately. This leads to zero progress at all
            because you keep switching between plans and ideas that none end up
            being completed. The Eight of Wands also hint at your repudiation of
            change because you are blocking the flow of energy that leads to
            change. This is making things more difficult as it's not letting you
            grow and stopping you from coming out of your shell.
          </p>
          <p>
            Stop being so precocious and sceptical and be in sync with the flow.
            If you feel you are stuck in a place and do not have the motivation
            to move forward with the current way, try changing the way and doing
            things differently. Eight of wands reversed also indicates being
            patient and trustful. You must be feeling frustrated and angry with
            yourself about something you did previously, like something you set
            in motion but the same thing turned out to be the obstacle. But
            dwelling on the past will take you nowhere. Forgive yourself and
            move forward with your life.
          </p>

          <h3>Love and Relationships (Reversed)</h3>
          <p>
            In a love and relationship tarot card reading, if the eight of wands
            appear reversed this indicates that there are chances of
            misunderstanding and miscommunication in your relationship and with
            your partner. Even if you are single, your relationship with your
            friends and close family members may come into danger because of
            words that are interpreted differently than it was intended. Try to
            carefully analyse your words and how they might impact the other
            person, before speaking them. Your actions should also be thought
            about and evaluated more even if you are tempted to do them quicker.
          </p>
          <p>
            Reconsider doing anything impulsive and give the other person time
            without forcing your ideas on them or making plans together
            beforehand. The Eight of Wands are reversed to indicate a time of
            action and getting things done. This means that your life is about
            to get very busy because of which you will not be able to give much
            time to your relationship or your partner. This will make you lose
            communication with your partner, and create confusion and
            misunderstanding. Know that this time is just as vital for them just
            as much as it is for you. Give them the benefit of the doubt, and
            keep the flow of communication going.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Eight of Wands reversed can also be interpreted as jealousy
            among the members of the relationship. You might be experiencing
            feelings of jealousy in terms of your partner, but know that they
            are uncalled for and have no basis. The reason why you are jealous
            does not have much meaning and significance and will not affect you
            or your partner in any way.
          </p>

          <h3>Finances (Reversed)</h3>
          <p>
            The eight of wands in the reversed position can indicate that when
            it comes to your finances, you are likely to be feeling frustrated
            and unfulfilling the most right now. Chances are that right now you
            do like the speed at which you are receiving money. You must have
            invested a large sum recently and had expectations that very soon
            you will receive double the amount you invested. But that is not the
            case for you right now, because your bank balance is increasing at a
            very slow speed which is frustrating you a lot. But this Minor
            Arcana tarot card advises you to have patience during this time.
            Even if you do not like the speed at which you are gaining money,
            know that you are most likely not losing any, which is a very
            positive sign.
          </p>
          <p>
            Slowly but surely you are making progress and this time is just as
            crucial for you as such. Everything that you are investing in right
            now, be it small or big, is going to bring fruitful results in the
            future, even if it feels frustrating for now. You might be feeling
            that the job you are doing right now is not as fulfilling and is not
            paying you enough, knowing that you are still in the process of
            paying your dues, and soon you will find a job or profession which
            will provide you with all the fulfilment that one requires in their
            life.
          </p>

          <h3>Career (Reversed)</h3>
          <p>
            When the Eight of Wands Minor Arcana tarot card (reversed), in terms
            of career, the reading can go two ways. The first is that maybe you
            are feeling a sense of stagnation in your job. Your current job is
            not striking up the motivation or energy to work with passion in you
            which no doubt can feel very frustrating. This feeling could be due
            to opportunities in the past that you missed taking advantage of,
            and now you are feeling frustrated. You failed to take the
            opportunity and use it to your advantage to move forward or higher
            in your career. But if that is not the case, then this card can be
            interpreted as moving too fast. You have been promoted to a role of
            authority, which you feel like you are not prepared for. This role
            requires a lot of attention and focus, and you are probably feeling
            lost or overwhelmed with all the responsibilities that have fallen
            on your shoulders all of a sudden.
          </p>
          <p>
            You feel that you have moved too fast, and feelings grow because of
            what others working under you are asking from you. To cope with
            these feelings, try consulting with others in the same position as
            you but with more experience and try to learn how they cope with all
            these responsibilities. If the new project seems daunting, talk with
            those with more experience and knowledge. This will help you to
            grasp the new role quicker and make you understand the right ways.
          </p>

          <h3>Health (Reversed)</h3>
          <p>
            The Eight of Wands reversed is not a good sign when it comes to
            health and wellness. This card can indicate health problems that
            will take a toll on you. If you are going through treatment or have
            recently discovered an illness you are suffering from, the
            appearance of this card indicates that you will have to struggle
            quite a bit before you are healed. The process of recovery is going
            to take longer, or the illness could also become more severe and
            your health might take a nosedive, because of which you will feel
            disheartened and lost.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you get an injury during this time, know that it will take longer
            than usual to heal. The eight of wands also represent that maybe you
            are having a lack of activities that will keep your body moving, or
            you are too active, which is leading to fatigue. This card also
            indicates that you must have started a new diet in the hopes of
            improving your health, but unfortunately, that diet is not working
            as you anticipated.
          </p>

            spring, of the zodiac signs season Aries, Sagittarius, or Leo. In
            numbers, if one wants to count, they should expect the time to be
            one month later, or specifically the 8th, 17th, 26th, or the
            upcoming month.

            Keep in mind that whatever you are wishing for is right around the
            corner and needs just a bit of patience. You will soon figure out
            the time. If the reading is done during the summer season, this does
            not mean that your wish will be fulfilled during the spring.

            It could also be interpreted by taking the number of the card. In
            this case, the number is eight, so you should expect it to be during
            the 8th day, 8th week, or 8th month of the reading. It is hard to
            predict the future taking into consideration years since our future
            keeps changing with every action we take.
