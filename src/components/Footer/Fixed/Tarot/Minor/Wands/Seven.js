          <h3>Seven of Wands Tarot Card Description</h3>
          <p>
            The image on the card of seven of wands depicts a man standing on
            top of a high building or hill and assessing his challengers below
            him. The man is not cowering away in fear of the attackers and even
            if he seems to be alone and by himself, he is stubbornly holding and
            protecting his position. To read the body language, we realise that
            he is standing his ground, being brave, and defending his territory
            and position while attacking back with retaliation. This can be
            interpreted as bravery and challenge, someone who is not scared to
            fight back even if the numbers are uneven.
          </p>
          <p>
            No matter the pressure, not fearing the opponent is the key to
            success. With closer inspection, we notice that the man is not
            wearing matching shoes in the original Rider-Waite depiction. This
            can be interpreted as maybe the man is not standing on even grounds
            and is unstable in general in his life currently. Even if he has the
            courage and dedication to protect what's his, he seems to be in a
            critical situation, and he should evaluate every step.
          </p>

          <h2>Seven of Wands (Upright)</h2>
          <h3>Upright Seven of Wands Meaning</h3>
          <p>
            After the fulfilling and satisfying feeling of success induced by
            the six of wands, the Seven of Wands in the upright position
            interprets struggle and hardships. Unlike five of wands, where you
            had to struggle to attain a position, with this card, you have
            already secured an eloquent position for yourself in society, and it
            indicates your struggle to maintain that position. You are in a very
            good place now, and everyone knows about it. So naturally, you have
            started to grow competition and rivals that are ready to take your
            position, if you slightly lose your grip.
          </p>
          <p>
            This card represents the continuous struggle to maintain the streak
            of success and to defend your title to prove that you deserve it.
            This card is a warning that others are plotting behind your back to
            get to the position you are in, so be aware and prepared. Chances
            are that you are going to be challenged to prove your worth, or to
            prove that your project or idea deserved all the recognition that it
            received. And these challenges will come from outside sources.
          </p>
          <p>
            Keep believing in yourself and stay dedicated to your work and
            beliefs and you will easily be able to overcome all the problems.
            The indication of the seven of wands is to stay put in your position
            by believing in yourself and your capabilities, no matter how hard
            the situation gets. You will have to fight those who are aiming to
            take your position from you. Time may get hard, and many major
            setbacks may occur, but keep staying strong and hold your ground.
            Confront those who are challenging you and don't back down easily.
          </p>

          <h3>Love and Relationships (Upright)</h3>
          <p>
            In a love and relationship tarot card reading, the Seven of Wands
            (upright) indicate a time to set boundaries and territory, even if
            the situation makes other parties uncomfortable. Chances are that
            the relationship between you and your partner is going to be
            challenged by external forces, such as family members not wanting
            you to be together, society objecting, or other suitors trying to
            create disputes and misunderstandings between the two of you. So you
            might have to take on a lot of challenges against all kinds of
            external things that are becoming a threat to your partnership to
            protect and defend your relationship.
          </p>
          <p>
            But you have confidence in yourself and your partner. You believe,
            and you are not wrong to believe it, that you have built a beautiful
            and amazing relationship which is based on love and trust, and every
            effort and struggle is worth it to save that relationship matter
            what. Keep a firm belief in yourself and your plans, and you will
            surely overcome these testing times very soon.
          </p>

          <h3>Finances (Upright)</h3>
          <p>
            This Minor Arcana tarot card represents success when it comes to
            finances and money. This card indicates that you will have a fortune
            if you have invested money somewhere. You are getting back profit
            from an investment you made a long time ago, or you will be making
            one that is going to result in fruitfulness. You are demonstrating
            financial foresight during this time because you have the sense that
            even if you are financially stable for now, this stability is
            fleeting and can be taken away at any time, so you are preparing
            beforehand.
          </p>
          <p>
            You could be planning to buy a house, set up bigger savings, or
            indulge in retirement plans. No matter the choice, these investments
            are surely going to benefit you in the future. Jealousy and envy are
            also indicated by the seven of wands reversed. So be aware of people
            being jealous of your position and stability on the financial
            ground.
          </p>

          <h3>Career (Upright)</h3>
          <p>
            Challenges and persistence is the most important indication of the
            seven of wands tarot card, in the upright position. And the same
            applies to your work and profession. Although it might seem jarring
            and scary, this card doesn't necessarily represent negative things.
            You should take this card as a warning as it indicates to you the
            upcoming challenges that might catch you off guard if you are not
            prepared, and overcome these challenges with willpower and
            dedication.
          </p>
          <p>
            Be confident in yourself and the success that you have achieved in
            work and keep moving forward with your head held high, even if other
            people are jealous of your position at work. People are waiting to
            attack at the slightest wavering they see from you, and you will be
            constantly challenged for your position and morals. But you have
            reached where you are right now with sheer force and determination.
            So it is not that easy to take you down. Keep being persistent and
            brave, and you will easily overcome these challenges.
          </p>

          <h3>Health (Upright)</h3>
          <p>
            In terms of health tarot card reading, the upright Seven of Wands
            represent challenges and struggle. You have come in association with
            an illness that is becoming nuances for you. This card indicates
            that you might have to struggle quite a bit due to this illness. You
            will have to fight a lot to get rid of this illness and even then it
            might not end up leaving.
          </p>
          <p>
            But keep being persistent and endure it with determination and
            strength, both physical and mental. Even if it becomes very
            challenging, with sheer determination you will be able to keep this
            illness in control and be free from it completely.
          </p>

          <h2>Seven of Wands (Reversed)</h2>
          <h3>Reversed Seven of Wands Tarot Card Meaning</h3>
          <p>
            When the Seven of Wands appear reversed, this indicates that you
            might be feeling overwhelmed by the challenges that keep occurring
            regularly, or the new responsibilities that have been put upon your
            shoulders because of the new position. With everything so hectic and
            in the face, it is becoming hard for you to relax and see your life
            as a blessing. You might be finding it hard to see the bigger
            picture because right now everything seems challenging. Because of
            this, you are constantly bound to compare yourself with others,
            which in return makes you doubt yourself and your potential, making
            you feel vulnerable and inadequate.
          </p>
          <p>
            This card also represents constant judgement and criticism. This
            card in the reversed position interprets your feelings and emotions
            as you feel you are being judged because of your decisions. You are
            feeling overwhelmed because your family and friends keep criticising
            the decisions you made, which in turn is making you feel inadequate
            to make your own decisions. You are feeling demotivated and unsure
            about yourself and your capabilities. It is a general interpretation
            to back down or give up by the reversal of the Seven of Wands.
          </p>
          <p>
            Although you have worked hard enough for the current position you
            have, it is becoming hard to feel satisfaction as you keep avoiding
            confrontation and keep running away when you see a challenging
            approach. It is suggested that no matter how hard it seems right
            now, you should keep reminding yourself how much work and effort you
            had to put in to get the position you have right now and if it's
            truly worth it to throw everything away with the slightest of
            inconvenience. Another interpretation of seven of wands reversed is
            that you are trying too hard to protect yourself and your position,
            and that is ruining your relationships.
          </p>

          <h3>Love and Relationships (Reversed)</h3>
          <p>
            The reversed seven of wands in a love tarot card reading interprets
            that you are holding on to something that is not healthy. You are
            trying too hard to defend your relationship and your partner, but it
            is hurting you as well as your partner in the process. It is
            possible that the relationship you are trying so hard to protect and
            keep intact is actually on shaky ground and your close ones can feel
            it.
          </p>
          <p>
            Your friends and family can see the agitation you are in as you
            struggle to make your relationship work, and are worried about you.
            Maybe you are still not seeing the problems and are currently in
            denial. Love is making it hard for you to see everything. Another
            interpretation of the Seven of Wands reversed is that maybe you are
            with the right person and are very sure about your relationship, but
            troubles from the outside are making it hard for you, or external
            forces are trying to pull the two of you apart.
          </p>

          <h3>Finances (Reversed)</h3>
          <p>
            Be careful and aware of every situation and do not be overconfident.
            The seven of wands reversed is hinting to you that no matter how
            secure you feel about your finances, you should not take everything
            for granted because ups and downs are a part of life, and no one can
            escape that.
          </p>
          <p>
            This card is warning you against wasteful expenditure and keeping
            note of all your expenses, and whether you need to spend the
            thousands. Avoid useless purchases even in times when you feel you
            are obligated. Even if you think that you are very much capable of
            spending money, keep your urges in control and start saving as fast
            as possible, especially during this time.
          </p>

          <h3>Career (Reversed)</h3>
          <p>
            The Seven of Wands (Reversed) can be a sign that you are finding it
            difficult to stay steady and defend yourself in your career. Your
            position is being threatened by your rivals, and you are not able to
            hold your ground which is frustrating you. The reason behind this
            could be your lack of preparation or planning which you were
            supposed to work on before you achieved your goals, on how you would
            defend your position and prove to everyone your potential. Your lack
            of preparation is keeping you from defending your past victories,
            your principles, and your values.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Seven of Wands reversed indicates or suggests you strongly hold
            your ground and keep defending your position as it is extremely
            crucial, but it seems like you are just not in the mental space or
            mood right now to do so. With success comes hardships and
            responsibilities, as well as enemies who are envious and want what
            you have. People are constantly attempting to attack you with the
            slightest hint of wavering. So you need to be aware of everyone,
            even those who are close to you. Your current choices were not the
            best ones, and this has made you vulnerable, which your enemies can
            see too.
          </p>

          <h3>Health (Reversed)</h3>
          <p>
            The seven of wands reversed is a sign that maybe you are getting
            tired or overwhelmed by an illness and losing the will to fight
            anymore. This card indicates that maybe you have been struggling
            with an illness for a long time, but it's getting very hard to
            defeat it completely, and it's becoming very taxing for your mental
            health. Because of this, your motivation to fight and defend your
            body is diminishing day by day and you feel like you don't have any
            other option but to give up at this point.
          </p>
          <p>
            An illness or condition is spiralling out of control and you are not
            able to do anything but suffer is what this card is indicating. You
            should consult your doctor, or think of changing them because the
            current treatment is not helping anymore.
          </p>

          <h2>Seven of Wands: One Card Pull</h2>
          <p>
            One card pull is done when you want to have straight to the point
            and quick answers. It is for the time when you wish to know specific
            answers in the form of Yes or No. So, if you are going through any
            tough situation or are stuck in a dilemma, getting a one-card pull
            is always helpful. Post shuffling the card, you can choose one from
            the deck. Depending on your question, you shall get the answer to
            the question. The results for one card pull in the seven of wands
            card is:
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Upright Position:</strong> If the seven of wands are pulled
            in the upright position, this means that the answer is yes, but you
            stay firm in your beliefs and hold your ground.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Reversed Position:</strong> If the seven of wands are pulled
            in the reversed position, the answer is still yes, but this card is
            hinting to you that you need to take some rest and work on restoring
            your energy before working for your goal.
          </p>

          <h2>Seven of Wands Card for Timing</h2>
          <p>
            If the question is about the exact time when something you are
            wishing for will come to reality, and the seven of wands have been
            pulled out, this can indicate that the time is very near. To be very
            specific about the time, one should expect it to be during the
            spring, of the zodiac signs season Aries, Sagittarius, or Leo.
          </p>
          <p>
            In numbers, if one wants to count, they should expect the time to be
            one month later, or specifically the 7th, 16th, 25th, or the
            upcoming month. Keep in mind that whatever you are wishing for is
            right around the corner and needs just a bit of patience. You will
            soon figure out the time. If the reading is done during the summer
            season, this does not mean that your wish will be fulfilled during
            the spring.
          </p>
          <p>
            It could also be interpreted by taking the number of the card. In
            this case, the number is "seven", so you should expect it to be
            during the 7th day, 7th week, or 7th month of the reading. It is
            hard to predict the future taking into consideration years since our
            future keeps changing with every action we take.
