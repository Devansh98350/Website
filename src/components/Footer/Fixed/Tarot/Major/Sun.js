          <h3>Key Meanings (Upright)</h3>
          <p>
            Enlightenment, joy, marriage, material happiness, success, vitality

          <h3>The Sun Tarot Card Description</h3>
          <p>
            The Sun exudes happiness and optimism. The sky is lit up by a huge,
            brilliant sun, which stands for the origin of all life present on
            Earth. Underneath, four sunflowers that stand for the Minor Arcana's
            four suits and the four elements rise over a brick wall. A small
            youngster who is completely nude is perched on top of a serene white
            horse in the foreground. The child is a representation of the
            happiness that comes from connecting with your inner soul, and his
            nakedness shows that he has nothing whatsoever to hide and is pure
            and innocent like a young child. Additionally, a symbol of power and
            purity is the white horse.
          </p>
          <p>
            An optimistic and contented mood is depicted by this Major Arcana
            tarot card. The morning that follows the longest, darkest night is
            symbolised by this card. All life on Earth derives from the Sun,
            which also serves as a metaphor for life's vital force. The image on
            the card shows a little youngster playing happily in the foreground.
            It reflects the joy that comes from being in harmony with your
            actual self and is a representation of our innocence. The fact that
            the toddler is nude shows that he has nothing to conceal. The card
            also shows the pure purity and innocence of children. This is
            especially highlighted by the white horse the youngster is astride.
            Here, the horse is also a representation of power and majesty.
          </p>
          <p>
            Given that this card also signifies success and passion, things
            should have been going well for you. People will gravitate toward
            the joy and good feelings you are radiating, and you will spread
            happiness and sunshine to everyone and anything you meet and
            interact with. You'll have a carefree, uninhibited, and secure
            sensation. Given that it is also the card of truth, if you've been
            the sufferer of lies or dishonesty, The Sun Major Arcana card will
            arrive to expose the lies and their perpetrators. In the Tarot, the
            upright Sun card also represents luck. The comfort this card gives
            will make any issues you've been having vanish.
          </p>

          <h2>The Sun (Upright)</h2>
          <h3>Upright The Sun tarot card meaning</h3>
          <p>
            The Sun (upright) stands for achievement, brilliance, and plenty.
            The Sun offers you courage and assures you that your dazzling,
            upbeat energy will accompany you everywhere you go and bring you
            pleasure and joy no matter what you do. You attract others because
            you always keep a positive attitude and provide so much warmth to
            their life. What will help you achieve and get you through difficult
            times is this lovely, loving energy. Additionally, you are in a
            position to share with people your best traits and accomplishments.
            Radiate your identity and your values; shine your affection on the
            people you care about.
          </p>
          <p>

            promise you have been expecting if you've been going through a
            challenging time: things will get much, much better! You learned
            about yourself and your purpose for being here by overcoming the
            obstacles in your way. You are now energised and zealous for the
            future, and you can already see success and wealth coming your way.

            everything will turn out just fine. The wonderful life!
          </p>
          <p>
            Moreover, this tarot card links you to your source of power, which
            is the rich inner energy that is already shining through you rather
            than the egotistical, fear-based power. It will call you to honestly
            express who you are and to be completely aware of the world around
            you. You'll feel it in your Solar Plexus chakra. You are being urged
            to give the world a powerful outpouring of your energy and abilities
            because you have what people desire. To express your power
            constructively, tap into it and employ your Divine will.
          </p>

          <h3>Love and Relationships (Upright)</h3>
          <p>
            If you are in a romance, The Sun in a relationship tarot card
            reading denotes immense delight and contentment. It can signal a
            time when your relationship is positive, passionate, and
            entertaining. In addition, the Sun's upright position sheds light on
            everything in its path, including relationships, thus it may also
            portend that any troubles in your relationship that are concealed
            will come to light. The Sun will bring an end to any problems it has
            brought to light for your overall good. The relationship could
            become more honest and open as a result, or it can dissolve
            altogether so that you might find a better one. For confirmation,
            check the supported cards. Whatever happens, The Sun will bring
            something wonderful and positive into your romantic life.
          </p>
          <p>
            A celebration, such as a proposal or wedding, can also be predicted
            by The Sun. If you're single, The Sun suggests that a wonderful
            relationship may be in your future. It can also mean that you'll be
            enjoying the enjoyable features of being single and feeling
            carefree. One of the major Tarot deck pregnancy signs, regardless of
            whether you are dating or not, is The Sun. Take the necessary
            safeguards if you're not prepared to have kids.
          </p>

          <h3>Finances (Upright)</h3>
          <p>

            it appears in your reading, you ought to be performing extremely
            well financially. All of your business endeavours, financial
            investments, and other money-making projects ought to be successful.
            Remember to set aside part of your riches to pay off any secret
            debts you may have as they may also arise now. Your financial
            condition may be favourable and cosy right now. The Sun denotes a
            state of thankfulness, plenty, and joy, and a monetary tarot reading
            is no exception to this rule. Additionally, the sun sheds light on
            objects, illuminating them and bringing them into the open. Any
            financial-related elements that have been kept a secret can now be
            disclosed.
          </p>
          <p>
            When upright The Sun appears, your financial status should be
            secure, which is fantastic news. If the sun emerges, you might
            anticipate receiving a financial reward for your dedication to and
            enthusiasm for your work. If you work for yourself, it may
            occasionally be advised that you get a promotion or start a new
            business. Financial independence may be something you're
            progressively acquiring if you've been wise with your money. When
            you succeed, you may remember how difficult circumstances were back
            in the past. Self-congratulate yourself and let those thoughts
            motivate you.
          </p>

            excited about the new changes that are heading your way. You'll be
            equipped and prepared to go right in and finish any assignment. The

            changing jobs since it signifies the achievement of objectives and
            success, so when it appears, things should be going smoothly at
            work. You could grow into a skilled or an authority in your field or
            reach a specific level of skill in your line of work. If you are
            presently enrolled in school, it can entail getting a college
            scholarship or other forms of financial help.
          </p>
          <p>

            intense excitement, motivation, and satisfaction for your
            profession. You could feel fulfilled in your profession on a

            equilibrium, optimism, and wellness when it occurs in your tarot
            session. The Sun is a sign of good health if you have recently been
            unwell. By being aware of your welfare and the needs of your health,
            you are showing excellent self-control. As a consequence, you should
            feel better than before, both physically and mentally. The Sun

            the growth of your inner wisdom. If you've been working on
            developing your spiritual abilities, you may have noticed that your
            previous spiritual growth efforts are starting to pay off as you get
            better at managing your talents. The Sun upright, one of the major
            pregnancy cards, is also a positive sign if you're attempting to get

            path to enlightenment has to offer in a spiritual atmosphere. It
            represents enlightenment. You have finally arrived at a position of
            real knowledge, enlightenment, and satisfaction after all the
            difficulties, hardships, and afflictions the Major Arcana has hurled
            at you. You are aware of your journey and content to let events take
            their course within their own time since you fully trust the
            universe's compassion for you and the direction it is taking.
          </p>

          <h2>The Sun (Reversed)</h2>
          <h3>Reversed The Sun tarot card meaning</h3>
          <p>
            Your inner kid is beckoning you to let go when you get The Sun
            (reversed) tarot card during the tarot card session. Adults often
            lose sight of having pleasure because of the daily commotion.
            However, if you spend even a little amount of time watching a child
            play, you will quickly come to understand how delightful and
            wonderful life can be if you decide to surrender to all cares and
            fears. When The Sun Reversed appears in a Tarot reading, consider it
            a green light to take a break from your obligations and duties, even
            if it's just for a little period.
          </p>
          <p>
            Let your soul and your heart soar free as you dance and sing without
            anybody else there. You may be finding it difficult to see the
            positive side of life if the sun is reversed. You could have
            encountered failures that diminished your zeal and optimism and
            possibly made you wonder if you could accomplish what you started to
            accomplish. You can feel down or excluded and stop enjoying the task
            at hand. Your future course and direction can seem hazy or skewed.
            However, The Sun is rarely a bad card, therefore this is merely a
            short-term situation.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you set your mind to it, you can quickly erase the impediments
            you observe. It could simply require a little bit more work than
            normal. On the other hand, you could be too optimistic or
            self-assured. Although you are self-assured, you could have allowed
            your confidence to make you egocentric and blind to your potential.
            Do you speak the truth to others and yourself? Or are you attempting
            to sell yourself short by talking yourself up? Ask for criticism and
            a bit of perspective from others if this strikes a chord with you.
          </p>

          <h3>Love and Relationships (Reversed)</h3>
          <p>
            If you are in a romantic connection, The Sun reversed might suggest
            that you feel abandoned by your significant other. The relationship
            may have lost some of its fire or flame. It can suggest a failed
            relationship or a postponed wedding. It can mean that you are
            struggling to imagine a future for both you and your spouse. It may
            also be an indication of rivalry or a desire to gain an advantage
            over one another. Spend quality time with your partner, try to
            emphasise the good aspects of your relationship, and keep in mind
            the reasons you started dating initially in the first instance. If
            you're currently single, The Sun reversed may be a sign that your
            egotism has grown to the point that you are scaring away possible
            companions. In reality, impressing a prospective spouse could
            backfire since it might appear like you are always bragging. Just
            turn it down a little. If you let go of your ego and simply be
            yourself, they will react to you far better!
          </p>
          <p>
            Even though there may be clouds in the sky right now, this card
            shines Even if everything in your relationship is going well, you
            could still be bored. Are you assuming too much about your
            relationship? Have your everyday routines and monotonous duties
            caused you and your spouse to drift apart? Additional time spent
            together may be necessary for the two of you to reignite your
            passion. The Sun is usually a good card, whether it is upright or
            reversed, but when it is, it typically indicates that something is
            keeping you from realising all the lovely things you already have.
            Why did you find yourself in love with your partner? What aspects of
            your relationship might you be grateful for?
          </p>

          <h3>Finances (Reversed)</h3>
          <p>
            The Sun reversed in a business tarot card reading might be a poor
            sign. It's possible for investments to lose value or for you to
            briefly get into financial trouble. Consider your financial concerns
            seriously and consider whether there is something you might be doing
            to address them as The reversed Sun Tarot card typically represents
            problems that are your fault. Reversed, the Sun might imply that
            your worries regarding your financial position may only last a brief
            time and may not be as terrible as you initially thought.
            Alternately, make sure that the financial judgments you're making
            right now are well-thought-out and supported by strong reasoning.
          </p>
          <p>
            Being extremely idealistic and unrealistic might be indicated by
            this card in the deck. Keep your hopes in check but temper your
            expectations. It can act as a warning to company owners that they
            shouldn't let their standards slip since it represents poor work,
            low quality, hurried labour, or poorly handled jobs, which can
            result in a bad reputation or lost sales. If you are presently
            working for a company, it warns you to focus because if you don't
            put out the appropriate effort, failed projects might incur a
            financial loss. On the other side, The Sun in reversed position
            might signify overextending oneself or being a workaholic. In that
            case, try to keep things balanced.
          </p>

          <h3>Career (Reversed)</h3>
          <p>
            The Sun reversed might represent feeling constrained or imprisoned
            by your profession in a career environment. There's a good chance
            that you can stop this persecution. For instance, you can be pulling
            too many hours and feeling exhausted, but you haven't requested the
            time away you require to recharge. Reversed, the Sun Tarot card can
            also mean that success is eluding you. Due to your lack of
            self-assurance and confidence, you may be passing up possibilities.
            Alternatively, it can mean that you have unrealistic job objectives
            or that you are relying solely on optimism to go where you want to
            go rather than taking the necessary practical measures.
          </p>
          <p>
            Additionally, it can be a sign that you operate in a competitive
            atmosphere where being arrogant or competitive is seen favourably.
            Regardless of its position, it still portends good things, but they
            may be obscured by a person's incapacity to recognise and perceive
            what is there. The Sun advises that all you need to do to find
            pleasure is to just carefully remove the clouds and realize what you
            already have if you've been feeling down, sad, or pessimistic about
            your situation at work. Do you feel depleted and worn out? Your
            workplace may help you get the rest you require. Maybe you believe
            your pay is insufficient. You might be able to earn the promotion
            you deserve by bringing this to the attention of your superiors.
          </p>

          <h3>Health (Reversed)</h3>
          <p>
            The Sun (reversed) might suggest that your mindset or pessimism may
            be aggravating your health problems in a health reading. The Sun
            reversed indicates that healing is possible if you have become
            unwell, but you'll need to take charge of your rehabilitation and
            keep an optimistic mindset to improve your health. A difficult or
            unexpected pregnancy, a miscarriage, a stillbirth, or an abortion
            can also be predicted by the Sun in reverse. It can be an indication
            that you are overly concerned with your physique in ways that are
            detrimental to your health and happiness, such as restricting
            yourself or excessive bodybuilding. Alternatively, you might go the
            other direction and completely disregard your health and fitness
            through poor nutrition, inactivity, abusing alcohol or other drugs,
            or overeating. In any case, the Sun in reverse conveys the idea that
            you need to find a healthy equilibrium to advance your long-term
            well-being.
          </p>
          <p>
            Reversed The Sun suggested that you could be finding it difficult to
            accept the pleasure that faith has to give. You can feel as though
            you are unable to glimpse your future and that the world no longer
            believes in its love for you. Because of the overpowering negative
            thoughts and emotions, you are unsure of where it is going and do
            not believe it is in a favourable direction. The Sun being in

          <h2>The Sun Card for Timing</h2>
          <p>
            When you ask The Sun about the time of an event, it tells you that
            it will start happening during the Aries season. Within the next
            four weeks, an unanticipated incident and a secret prophecy may both
            come true. The Sun says that everything you want or wonder about
            will develop gradually if you're unsure of when something will
            happen. The flood will however continue to increase since the card
            depicts a flowing action that is constant yet potent.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Major Arcana tarot card also predicts that you will feel
            cherished, admired, supported, and in control of everything as a
            result of your pleasant occurrence. You will soon finish any
            relationship-related tasks in your life as this tarot card
            represents love. It also indicates probable connections. The length
            of time it takes for both occurrences to happen will thus appear to
            be a defect. So consider it an excellent card if you're raising
            concerns about the passage of time.
