          <h3>Justice Tarot Card Description</h3>
          <p>
            The Justice Tarot card is titled The Daughter of the Lords of Truth.
            "The Balance Master." The justice figure on the card with scales and
            balances is a traditional representation of justice. With ease,
            justice can be distinguished from love. Her insignia are the Sword
            and Scales. She dresses in green, like her sister, but it's a
            colder, harsher green than Isis' brilliant emerald. Blue, blue
            green, and pale green are also associated with the Tarot card The
            Justice. Only by using flashing colours can we discover the
            constancy and warmth that are hidden.
          </p>
          <p>
            The figure of Justice is positioned between two pillars that
            represent balance, law, and structure, and are similar to those that
            frame the High Priestess and The Hierophant. A loosely draped purple
            veil surrounds her, representing compassion.
          </p>
          <p>
            She holds a sword in her right hand, demonstrating the rational,
            organised thinking required to administer appropriate punishment.
            The double-edged sword represents that our decisions always have
            consequences and points upward to represent a firm and decisive
            decision. The scales in her left (intuitive) hand represent her
            objectivity and show how logic must be balanced by intuition.
            Justice wears a crimson robe with a green mantle and a crown with a
            small square on it to represent well-ordered thoughts. As a tiny
            white sneaker peeks out from beneath her clothes, the spiritual
            ramifications of your actions are brought to mind.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Justice tarot card represents truth, justice, and the rule of
            law. As she reclines in her chair, scales in her left hand depict
            how intuition and logic should coexist. As a symbol of objectivity,
            she holds a double-edged sword in her right hand. The square on her
            crown symbolises her need for mental clarity in order to administer
            justice. Behind her are a purple cloak and some tall grey pillars.
            She shows the toe of a white shoe from beneath her red shawl, which
            is clasped. This serves as a spiritual reminder that what she gives
            is the result of their actions.
          </p>

          <h2>Justice (Upright)</h2>
          <h3>Upright Justice tarot card meaning</h3>
          <p>
            The Justice card represents the rule of law, fairness, justice, and
            truth. You are being held responsible for your actions and will bear
            the consequences. You should not be concerned if your actions were
            in accordance with your Higher Self and for the benefit of others.
            Otherwise, you will be called out and made to accept responsibility
            for your actions. If you're nervous about this, keep in mind that
            the Justice card isn't as straightforward as you might think.
            Despite the fact that you may have done something you regret, this
            card indicates that you will be treated fairly and without
            prejudice. Compassion and understanding go hand in hand with
            justice.
          </p>
          <p>
            Prepare to admit your mistakes and accept responsibility for the
            outcomes. The Justice card indicates that if you pursue it, justice
            will be served. You might be involved in a court case or waiting for
            the outcome of one from a governing body or another organisation. A
            decision will be made soon. There are no retrials or second chances
            with the upright Justice card; once the verdict is rendered, you
            must accept it and move on.
          </p>
          <p>
            Justice is fundamentally about seeking the truth. As you delve
            deeper into your reality, you'll discover that things are more
            complicated than you initially thought. Prepare to wade into murky
            waters as you consider what truth means to you. Be cautious of what
            you believe to be true, as well as what you believe to be just and
            moral. It may not be as easy as you think, so be prepared to stretch
            yourself and discover new aspects of your worldview.
          </p>

          <h3>Love and Relationship (Upright)</h3>
          <p>
            If you are single and have a love of Tarot reading, Justice may
            suggest a relationship with someone in the legal field (judge,
            lawyer, legal secretary etc.) Because the Tarot card for Libra is a
            Libra, a Libra may be on the horizon for you. If you have served
            others with honesty and kindness but have not been treated well in
            relationships, Justice in a love tarot reading can indicate that
            this imbalance will be repaired with the loving partner you deserve
            entering your life. It may also imply that those who have mistreated
            you will be held accountable.
          </p>
          <p>
            Whether Justice is a good or bad sign for a relationship is
            ultimately determined by how you and your spouse act. If you are
            both sincere and moral in your relationship, you will reap the
            benefits in the form of greater harmony or a stronger commitment. It
            could represent the marriage contract and denote marriage. However,
            Justice says that if any of you has cheated or been dishonest, the
            truth will be revealed, and the dishonest person will pay the price
            for their actions.
          </p>
          <p>
            Because justice is about karma, if you've been working hard, love
            and romance will come your way. If you've been kind, kind, and
            helpful to others, your relationships will reflect that. People will
            find you extra appealing if you've been single because of your
            loving and upbeat personality.
          </p>

          <h3>Finance (Upright)</h3>
          <p>
            Our ability to manage our finances determines our ability to live a
            balanced life. The Justice tarot card indicates the strategy to be
            used in a specific situation. Money is an issue in this case.
            Although the card does not reveal your financial situation, it does
            explain how money should be managed and foreshadows long-term
            consequences. All of your business relationships must be fair. This
            will bring good fortune to your financial future. Being adaptable
            today will pay off later.
          </p>
          <p>
            Justice serves as a reminder that if you act honourably with money
            and business, you will be financially rewarded, and it can show you
            how to balance your books. If you're willing to take a chance on
            something, this card is a good omen.
          </p>
          <p>
            This card serves as a reminder to be honest, equitable, and fair in
            all of your financial dealings. Maintain a balance between your
            desires and those of others, as well as what you take and what you
            offer. If you keep everything in balance, your finances should be
            fine.
          </p>

          <h3>Career (Upright)</h3>
          <p>
            When Justice occurs in a professional setting, it serves as a
            reminder of the importance of balancing your personal and
            professional lives. Remember to give yourself enough alone time. A
            person's career is extremely important. Everyone must be financially
            self-sufficient, and ambition is not a bad thing. Consider how many
            people say to themselves as they die, "I wish I'd spent more time at
            work." While you're establishing and maintaining a job you're proud
            of, don't forget to make time for the people and things that are
            important to you.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you've been involved in any workplace issues, the Justice card
            can indicate that if you've been sincere, honest, and fair in your
            dealings, things should work out in your favour. If this does not
            apply to you, this card can serve as a simple reminder to always act
            honourably and accept responsibility for your actions, even if you
            make a mistake. People will respect and trust you for your honesty
            and dedication to the truth, even if it is frightening at times.
            Your career can advance if you act ethically and responsibly.
          </p>

          <h3>Health (Upright)</h3>
          <p>
            Justice serves as a reminder that if you act honourably with money
            and business, you will be financially rewarded, and it can show you
            how to balance your books. If you're willing to take a chance on
            something, this card is a good omen.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Justice tarot card is quite obvious when it comes to health and
            spirituality. Justice is built on a foundation of balance in all
            aspects of life. Do you take care of yourself as you should? The
            term "self-care" has become so overused that most of us don't even
            recognise it when we see it. The most important task, however, is to
            look after your body, mind, and spirit.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you are overwhelmed by the idea or are unsure where to begin,
            proceed with caution. Consider three goals, move cautiously toward
            each, and everything will be in balance before you know it. If you
            have been having health problems, Justice may suggest that you are
            out of balance, which may be a factor in those problems. It also
            discourages excessive indulgence in any area of your life.
            Moderation is essential.
          </p>

          <h2>Justice (Reversed)</h2>
          <h3>Reversed Justice tarot card meaning</h3>
          <p>
            Justice Reversed may imply that you are morally aware that what you
            did was wrong. You have two choices: hide it and hope no one finds
            out, or face your mistakes and take decisive action to correct the
            problem. Others may have overlooked it. Choose whatever feels right
            to you because the consequences of your decision will be borne on
            your conscience.
          </p>
          <p>
            According to Justice Reversed, you may not be ready to accept full
            responsibility for your actions and may try to "dodge the bullet" by
            blaming others. Your inability to rise above your own concerns and
            ego prevents you from seeing the bigger picture. You are deceiving
            both yourself and others. Examine your situation again with the goal
            of identifying areas where you can take responsibility. After you've
            admitted your mistake, make every effort to make things right. You
            will be able to make better decisions and be free of any guilt or
            shame as a result of doing so.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you are about to make a significant decision that will affect
            others, consider whether you have any biases or prejudices that may
            unfairly influence your decision. To make an informed decision or
            expose your own biassed opinions, you may need to gather more facts.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you are in a legal situation, you may be concerned about an
            unfair outcome or contest the verdict, casting doubt on the legal
            process. There could be problems with the law or something else that
            prevents justice from being served.
          </p>

          <h3>Love and Relationships (Reversed)</h3>
          <p>
            If you are in a romantic relationship, Justice Reversed could be a
            strong indicator that you are being exposed for lying or cheating.
            As a result, if you have been lying or cheating in your
            relationship, you should expect serious consequences. With this
            Major Arcana trump card in your Tarot reading, you may also discover
            that any disagreements you have with your partner seem to last
            forever. It could also be an indication that you don't feel treated
            fairly or equally in the relationship. Before passing judgement on
            your partner, consider your own contribution to the relationship.
            Consider whether it is fair to put all of the blame on your partner.
          </p>
          <p>
            Even if you believe you are not to blame for the relationship
            issues, you should make an effort to learn from the experience.
            Remember that we set the standard for how others should treat us,
            and we get back what we put up with. If you're single, Justice
            Reversed may indicate that, even if you believe you're ready for the
            relationship you deserve, you haven't taken the time to absorb the
            lessons you need to learn from previous relationships in order to
            move on and avoid repeating the same mistakes. It could also be a
            sign that you frequently lack equilibrium in your relationships,
            which could be why they are failing.
          </p>
          <p>
            When you meet someone, try to strike a balance between your romantic
            and independent lives. This will give your relationships the
            breathing room they require to grow. If justice has been reversed,
            it could mean that you are now paying for your unkind treatment of
            previous relationships. Everyone is swept up in the initial
            excitement of a new relationship, but be careful not to lose
            themselves completely!
          </p>

          <h3>Finances (Reversed)</h3>
          <p>
            Financially, avoid risky bets or investments because the appearance
            of this card is unlikely to bring you good fortune. It may indicate
            financial injustice; therefore, exercise extreme caution when
            dealing with anyone with money right now; they may not be
            trustworthy.
          </p>
          <p>
            When the Justice card is reversed in your reading, it indicates
            financial dishonesty. Before disclosing your financial information
            to anyone, make certain that they are trustworthy. If you've been
            having financial difficulties, the Justice card in reverse may
            represent a refusal to accept responsibility for your situation.
            Although it may sound unpleasant, accepting responsibility for a
            difficult situation can be liberating.
          </p>
          <p>
            The reversed stance of the Justice tarot card represents partiality
            and rigidity. As a result, it is not a good financial sign. When
            investing or incurring additional costs, exercise caution. The card
            does not discourage investing; rather, it emphasises the importance
            of doing everything exactly as it is written in the books. Maintain
            a close eye on your finances.
          </p>

          <h3>Career (Reversed)</h3>
          <p>
            Reversed justice may indicate that you are receiving unfair
            treatment at work. Perhaps people are holding you responsible for
            their flaws or faults. Perhaps you believe someone is attempting to
            destroy you. Whatever the situation, don't react too quickly. It is
            best to exercise caution and approach the situation logically. Don't
            rush in to confront the perpetrators because you're unlikely to win
            any arguments because justice works in reverse. If you have not been
            performing honourably in your professional life, your actions may be
            coming back to haunt you if justice is reversed. It could be a sign
            of commercial corruption.
          </p>
          <p>
            Instead of attempting to avoid the consequences, raise your hands
            and accept responsibility for your actions. As a result, you'll gain
            more respect. When this Major Arcana card appears in your reading,
            avoid focusing too much on either your professional or personal
            life. Justice reversed can also indicate a lack of work/life balance
            more than the upright card.
          </p>
          <p>
            It's possible that you're now dealing with unfair working
            conditions. This could include accepting responsibility for someone
            else's mistakes or putting up with someone else attempting to
            discredit your work. Despite the temptation, fighting fire with fire
            will only exacerbate the situation. Approach this problem with
            fairness, sanity, and candour. With inverted Justice, you can
            discover that tense exchanges may result in blame being placed on
            you. This card may occasionally indicate that you have not been
            entirely sincere in your work. This could cause problems in the
            future, or it could keep you awake at night wondering when the other
            shoe will drop.
          </p>

          <h3>Health (Reversed)</h3>
          <p>
            Justice reversed suggests a need for balance once more, but this
            time it's a stronger indication that a lack of balance may result in
            health problems. Make an effort to schedule self-care time and avoid
            overindulging.
          </p>
          <p>
            Inverted justice is a stronger indicator of an imbalance that can
            lead to health problems than it is of a lack of balance in the
            context of health. Make an effort to look after yourself and avoid
            overindulging.
          </p>

          <h2>Justice Card for Timing</h2>
          <p>
            The Justice card instructs you to pay close attention when others
            recount events and their roles in them for you. It is not necessary
            to offer criticism. Your job is to observe, pay close attention,
            participate fully, and maintain your cool as the drama unfolds.
          </p>
          <p>
            When you see how people describe themselves, your understanding will
            go beyond what you hear. By deducing hints and subtle inferences,
            you will learn the truths that will allow you to make an informed
            and precise decision. According to Justice, a significant event
            could occur within the next 30 days. The Justice card appears
            between two and three months and has a long and powerful influence
            (even a year and a half).
