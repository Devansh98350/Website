          <h3>The Hierophant Tarot Card Description</h3>
          <p>
            In the deck of Major Arcana tarot cards, The Hierophant is the
            masculine or male counterpart of The High Priestess. Recognized by
            the name teacher or Pope, it is generally ruled by the Taurus zodiac
            sign. The card depicts a masculine religious figure settled between
            two pillars of a shrine. However, if you would see it clearly, this
            temple looks way different from the one on The High Priestess card.
          </p>
          <p>
            He has three robes in three separate colors— red, blue, and white.
            Moreover, you can notice a three-tiered crown on his head. Both the
            accessories signify three different worlds that he governs— the
            conscious, subconscious, and superconscious. Ahead, you can also
            notice that in his left hand he has a Papal Cross, which illustrates
            his religious status. Looking to his right hand, you shall see that
            it is up in order to provide blessings. Two of his fingers are
            pointing up (towards Heaven) and two down (towards Earth).
          </p>
          <p>
            You can also notice that two followers are kneeling in front of him.
            And being a religious deity, the task of the Hierophant is to give
            and spread his spiritual knowledge to his followers and direct them
            towards church so they can begin with their roles and
            responsibilities there. Basically, this Major Arcana tarot card
            represents a clear passage to enter the next level of life—
            spirituality. Also, the crossed keys near the Hierophant's feet
            signify the proper equilibrium between the subconscious and
            conscious mind and other mysterious facts and truths of life, which
            only he can teach or explain to the people.
          </p>

          <h2>The Hierophant (Upright)</h2>

            indicates the welcome of conventional thoughts and ideas. It
            suggests that you wish to get into a procedure that is already well
            established. However, as much as you want to become a part of the
            ongoing, you want to stay within certain traditional limits and
            boundaries— following orthodox ideas and approaches. So, what do you
            do to become a part of the existential world? First, you try to
            adapt to the already existing thoughts and ideologies.

          <p>
            This upright tarot card indicates that you feel better performing
            what others are doing instead of being innovative or breaking the
            orthodox approach towards a certain thing in your life. Hinting more
            towards the spiritual ceremonies or traditional rituals, you become
            a part of such values and get trapped without considering that it
            could be wrong. So when this card appears in a reading, it signals
            institutions and their typical methods and values. And for you, it
            indicates a non-thinking phase, wherein you would do what exists and
            not think through the rules and situations from your viewpoint.

            connection with your partner will turn well, and some of you can
            also have new beginnings with your other half. Also, it signals the
            fact that near about times, you and your partner would be on the
            same page and shall have almost similar thoughts towards each other
            and your connection.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, if you are single, this Major Arcana tarot card represents
            that someone special will soon enter your life. And the relationship
            you will have shall be full of commitment and understanding. There
            will be security, undivided attention, and tendencies to help each
            other grow in life with fewer misunderstandings and more support.
            The Hierophant tarot card for singles also indicates a keen draw
            towards a partner who respects traditional values, is respected by
            the community and is safe for your future plans. As for you, it
            signals a feeling of respect for them and a deep thought process
            that will help you treat them better and properly.

          <h3>Finance (Upright)</h3>
          <p>
            Getting The Hierophant tarot card (upright) indicates the
            involvement of money in traditional practices and works. You might
            feel safe keeping them in conventional institutions rather than
            anywhere. Furthermore, you will believe in making money with noble
            methods— no cheating, no shortcuts! Even if it makes you hustle and
            work extra hard, you will get the good money in your pockets.
            Moreover, this Major Arcana card (upright) says that spending money
            will never be your thing. You will save more than spending.
            Therefore, there would be a sense of value towards earning methods
            and ways.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, on the other hand, you may struggle in adapting to the new
            finance gaining processes. All the new wealth-increasing methods
            like— investments in the stock market, making some side money, or
            buying assets for later might look problematic to you. In all, you
            will struggle in understanding these ways, which would keep you a
            mediocre earning being. You might be satisfied or feel good the way
            things are. However, sooner or later, you will feel the need to
            develop or change. But, the chances of making an effort to change
            will still be low.
          </p>

          <h3>Career (Upright)</h3>
          <p>
            In career, The Hierophant tarot card indicates success, but in teams
            or groups. It basically draws you towards doing teamwork and working
            solo less. Obviously, you can perform well alone, but the card
            indicates you do not hustle so much and go with the flow. Though
            after a certain point, you will become adaptable to the "teamwork
            system," and it will be hard to get out of it, you will still choose
            to be safe and play balanced instead of hitting the boat with a
            rock. The same will help your career grow and make you successful in
            the longer run.
          </p>

            students; will get help from their seniors. They will aid your
            career growth and help you improve your life. As the card also
            represents education, therefore, for students or people planning to

          <p>
            If you have been struggling hard with any health problems, getting
            The Hierophant tarot card upright in a reading signals that
            traditional treatments and cures would work best for you. Your
            health condition might become non-handleable if you opt for some
            conventional ways of getting better. Hustle or rush will also act
            badly in your situation, especially if the problem is more physical
            than internal. Moreover, getting this Major Arcana tarot card
            indicates strictness to follow what is advised by the doctor.

            people, this tarot card represents a fit and fresh time, but with
            strict healthy eating habits and a focus on building up your
            well-being. Moreover, it strongly indicates to the children to keep
            an eye on their physical activities, as it would keep them away from
            all the lethargic feelings and refresh them in the best way
            possible.
          </p>

          <h2>The Hierophant (Reversed)</h2>
          <h3>Reversed The Hierophant tarot card meaning</h3>
          <p>
            Getting The Hierophant tarot card reversed in a tarot card reading
            strongly indicates rebellion. It says it is high time, and you must
            break all the rules formed by the system and bring changes to the
            world. All those traditional practices, methods, and ways need to be
            away. And, you must follow the conventional ways to perform the
            tasks in your life. Ahead, reversed The Hierophant tarot card wants
            you to get rid of the social norms that challenge the rules and
            regulations around you or which must not be followed just for the
            sake of adaptability. Basically, this card is more for introspecting
            yourself around the fact that whatever you have been into all this
            while, was that even worth following?
          </p>
          <p>
            Ahead, The Hierophant (reversed) signals that you might have guilt
            or a feeling of embarrassment with the ways and methods you have
            been going on all through the course of your life. Clinging
            intensely to the traditional means of the world, you must change
            yourself and have an alternative lifestyle made with your own rules.
            You need to separate yourself from the society-shaming and follow
            what you think is appropriate. All these practices will help you
            learn authority, possess a vision of your own, and enjoy freedom.
          </p>

          <h3>Love and Relationships (Reversed)</h3>
          <p>
            Getting reversed The Hierophant tarot card in a relationship reading
            indicates that no charm is present in your relationship. It may have
            become boring, uninteresting, or not good enough for you and your
            partner. Basically, with time, all the excitement and understanding
            have gone under sheets, and the couples would feel like they are
            dragging it with their partner. So, it kind of warns the natives
            already in a relationship to make constant efforts, share views, and
            make constant conversations. Even though it would indicate a future
            together, you shall not believe in the same. Chances of separation
            could be there too.
          </p>
          <p>
            With nothing in alignment, The Hierophant (reversed) tarot card
            signifies that singles may have to become a dealbreaker and make
            compromises to get into a relationship that signals healthiness and
            fulfillment. Turning romantic around your partner, wooing them with
            sensual conversations, and trying to understand their expectations
            with the relationship, will help you strengthen your bond with them.
            For some people, this Major Arcana tarot card suggests patience and
            waiting for the right time to have the person in your life.
          </p>

          <h3>Finances (Reversed)</h3>
          <p>
            Restlessness would be the right for you in terms of finances when
            you get this Major Arcana tarot card in your reading. You will feel
            a rush to put money in investments and other places. It might lead
            you to some casualties and some losses because of the same. You will
            feel pleasure in taking risks with your money into unconventional
            and unconventional methods. Then again, there are high possibilities
            that you might lose your money because of such practices. Even if
            others would try to give you some advice, it will look stupid to
            you. Thus, working on your own intuitions will look like an easier
            task.
          </p>
          <p>
            With The Hierophant (reversed) tarot card, you will also figure out
            ways to earn some side money. Chances are high that you will learn
            new investment methods— cryptocurrency, investing in real estate,
            getting some other assets, etc. You shall be more practical and
            realistic than following just what others are doing to make money.
            Moreover, you would be more responsible in handling the wealth you
            have. However, success might make you greedy in the longer run. You
            will be enthusiastic about learning conventional forms of earning
            wealth. But, on the other hand, you might go on a spending spree
            too.
          </p>

          <h3>Career (Reversed)</h3>
          <p>
            Bound in limits, you might feel stuck in your workplace. Moreover,
            there could be a block that might force you to get out of the
            traditional working methods and try something of your own. The
            Hierophant tarot card (reversed) in career represents restrictions.
            You will feel confined to a no-growth range, where situations would
            look not to work in your favor or will not benefit your professional
            growth. Thus, with this tarot card (reversed), you must make a move
            to think out of the box and give yourself a fresh start in your
            career.
          </p>
          <p>
            For professional people, it acts as an indication to place your
            ideas too in the middle of others showing an alternative way of
            performing the same thing. But, remember, this card in a tarot
            reading never indicates being bossy or over-flaunting your skills
            and abilities. It simply asks you to be you and show the best
            opinions you got. For people facing issues in getting a job, try
            something new! Modify your resume and stop preparing or doing what
            others are already doing. Trust in yourself, a little rule breaker,
            and innovation is the prime motive of The Hierophant (reverse) tarot
            card.
          </p>

          <h3>Health (Reversed)</h3>
          <p>
            In case you are unwell, The Hierophant (reversed) tarot card signals
            that now is the most appropriate time to switch to alternative
            methods in your treatment. Try something that you haven't, something
            holistic, as it would benefit you greatly. If you act harsh on
            yourself, it will impact your health way too much. Thus, you must
            take relaxation and life's schedules hand in hand. Moreover, getting
            this tarot card in your tarot session, you should also remember that
            new ways of exercising and keeping yourself fit and fine will be the
            best you can do.
          </p>
          <p>
            Along with it, The Hierophant (reversed) card wants you to shake
            things up. The card even wants you to step outside your comfort zone
            and make new progress in your health. Children should be playful and
            leave digital things as much as possible. Also, they must not come
            under peer pressure as it could degrade their wellness immensely. To
            have proper health, people getting this Major Arcana tarot card
            should remember that old facts and figures would only cause
            suffering. However, fixing it with new beginnings and goals will
            help you achieve a healthy lifestyle.
          </p>

          <h2>The Hierophant Card for Timing</h2>
          <p>
            The Hierophant for timing indicates rapid possibility. So, when you
            have questions— when an event will occur in your life, this Major
            Arcana card foretells that a maximum of fifteen days would be the
            time limit for anything to happen in your life. However, sometimes
            it can extend to a month. The time after getting The Hierophant

            you some unexpected results.
          </p>
          <p>
            As this tarot card represents spirituality, any religious tasks in
            your life will soon be accomplished. Moreover, it also signifies
            education and marriage. Therefore, the time span for both things to
            happen will be like a shortcoming. So, consider it as a positive
            card when asking questions about timing. Not just this, if you are
            around the Taurus season, the possibilities of the same happening
            turn double.
