          <h3>The Fool tarot card description</h3>
          <p>
            The Fool in tarot card readings illustrates a young person walking
            happily into the universe. He is taking his first few steps, which
            is making him excited, joyful, and exuberant. He has nothing with
            him but a small sack. He cares for nothing— no hurdles, no dangers
            that shall be in his path in the future. For sure, he shall soon
            experience the very first of these possibilities, for if he moves a
            little forward, he would topple over the edge of the cliff he is
            approaching.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, this barely concerns him. And here, we are almost unsure
            whether he is naïve or unaware of the path he is on. The dog near
            his heels barks loudly at him, warning him to fall back. The dog
            tries to make him aware of the surroundings and warns him that if he
            moves forward, he might never see the adventures he longs or dreams
            for.
          </p>

          <h3>The Fool Tarot Card (Upright)</h3>
          <h4>Upright The Fool Tarot Card meaning</h4>
          <p>
            The Fool is the first card of the Major Arcana deck and is numbered
            0. It is usually considered as a positive tarot card as it indicates
            new beginnings. Moreover, it also signifies the infinite potential
            and innocence of the person when he is about to start his life. If
            The Fool card appears in your tarot card reading, it shall mean that
            you are about to start a new and exciting adventure in your life.
            This adventure would bring you new leanings along and demands a leap
            of faith in the process which is in front of you. But, with that, it
            promises you firmly new experiences. It could also mean a new actual
            adventure like travelling somewhere you have never been before.
            Despite the fact that it is a card for new ships, it could also mean
            that you must reconsider your decisions before you take that long
            leap.
          </p>
          <p>
            Moreover, the appearance of this tarot card in your reading also
            means that there are multiple opportunities under the rug, and with
            freedom and optimism, you shall be able to explore them all. It
            indicates great times ahead, but only if you are willing to use your
            brain in the right direction without acting insane or loose-headed.
            There might come times that people around you might make your way
            delusive. But, this upright Major Arcana card says that a good time
            would be there, indicating you towards growth and success in all
            your endeavours.
          </p>
          <h3>Love and Relationships (Upright)</h3>
          <p>
            Having The Fool when you have questions regarding your love life
            means you shall have a spontaneous, exciting, and romance-full love
            life. However, a little fickleness in the head of the partner comes
            with it. For people already in a relationship, this tarot card
            illustrates that you are mad in love and extra joyful about having
            your partner in your life. However, if it is about commitment, it
            indicates a lack of commitment or not being ready to take the
            relationship to the next level. For single people, The Fool
            (upright) signifies carefree and impulsive romance(s) with
            fun-filled times and sometimes an incoming of true love too.{" "}
          </p>
          <p>
            There could be chances that you shall meet your prospective partner.
            However, a match won’t be there if you don't value their presence in
            your life. People seeking someone won’t think twice before
            approaching any decision regarding them or their relationship. As
            for folks in a toxic relationship, the Fool upright card suggests
            freedom and better opportunities regarding self-love and
            self-healing. You may have been an insane and blind person in love,
            but with this Major Arcana card pulled out in your tarot reading,
            you would seek motivation in your life ahead.
          </p>

            and understand the worth of spending and savings. You shall also

            would lead you towards exciting journeys, full of adventures and

            worth of money. Also, if you are under any lending troubles or legal
            money issues, the time shall soon come when you shall be out of the

            take them. Either way, new beginnings would be there. When you get

            if things go out of plan. Indicating more negative traits, this

            the Fool reversed card illustrates that you shall act totally
            gullible. People shall prefer considering you as their last option,
            which would detach you from them in no time. There shall hardly be
            chances that you would take the initiative to begin conversations
            and later complain about the same, where blaming the person would be

            have an exciting and adventurous love life. However, on the other
            hand, you would be insecure in nature towards your partner, which
