          <h3>The High Priestess Tarot Card Description</h3>
          <p>
            The High Priestess is sitting in front of a thin purdah accessorised
            with pomegranates. This purdah illustrates the different
            subconscious and conscious realms, the unseen and the seen, and
            helps to keep casual onlookers at bay. Only the ones who initiated
            shall be able to enter. The pomegranates on the purdah represent the
            divine feminine, abundance, and fertility. It is sacred to
            Persephone. He ate a seed of pomegranate in the underworld and was
            forced to come every year.
          </p>
          <p>
            On both sides of the High Priestess are two big pillars. They mark
            the entry to this mystical place. One pillar is black and has the
            alphabet B, which is Boaz— meaning— in his strength. The other is
            white and engraved with the letter J, which is Jachin— meaning— he
            will establish. The black and white shades of the pillars signify
            dualism like male and female, darkness and light, to explain to the
            world that acceptance and knowledge of the dual nature of everything
            are mandatory to survive in this world.
          </p>
          <p>
            Moreover, from the High Priestess tarot, you shall see that the lady
            is in a blue robe possessing a cross on her chest and a horned
            crown. Both these accessories represent her divine wisdom and status
            as a ruler. In her hand, she is with a scroll which is partly shown,
            signifying that the holy knowledge is both implicit and explicit and
            shall get revealed if the person is ready to dig deeper and go
            beyond materialism. The crescent Moon, down near her feet,
            represents her bond with divine feminism, subconscious mind, and
            intuition.
