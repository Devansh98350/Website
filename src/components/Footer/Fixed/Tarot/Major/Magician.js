          <h3>The Magician tarot card description</h3>
          <p>
            The Magician tarot card in the Major Arcana deck is abundant in
            symbolism. The image in the centre shows a person whose one hand is
            pointing to the Universe and the other one is facing the ground. The
            way his hands are, they show the connection between materialism and
            spiritualism. The Magician card utilises this connection to manifest
            and make his aims in the physical realm.
          </p>
          <p>
            Moreover, if you observe it closely, you shall see that his robes
            are white, which represents purity. On the other hand, his cloak is
            red. It illustrates his knowledge and experience of the world. The
            table which is placed in front of him illustrates the four suits of
            tarot cards— Wand, Cup, Sword, and Pentacle. These four suits
            further represent the four elements— Fire, Water, Air, and Earth. It
            signifies that the Magician has all the elements that he shall
            require to become a proper being.
          </p>
          <p>
            The symbol above his head is an infinity symbol, and his waist
            possesses a snake biting his own tail. This illustrates that he is
            up to unlimited potential. The foreground depicts an array of
            flowers and foliage, signifying the fruition and blossoming of
            aspirations and new ideas.
