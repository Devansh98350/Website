          <h3>Key Meanings (Upright)</h3>
          <p>
            Obsession, adultery, dependency, mental illness, secrecy, and
            consumerism are just a few of the negative behaviours that might
            occur
          </p>

          <h3>Key Meanings (Reversed)</h3>
          <p>
            Detachment, independence, kicking the habit, freedom, revelation,
            regaining control, and realisation
          </p>

          <h3>The Devil tarot card description</h3>
          <p>
            The Devil, also known as Baphomet, is depicted on this card in his
            most well-known satyr form. The devil has bat wings, an inverted
            pentagram on his forehead, and is half goat, half man. He is
            positioned on a pedestal that has a naked man and lady bound to it
            as if to demonstrate his dominance over them. Both the man and the
            woman have horns as if to demonstrate how less human they become the
            more time they spend with the Devil. The chains give the impression
            that they are being held captive by the devil.
          </p>
          <p>
            The woman has a bowl of grapes on her tail while the guy holds a
            torch, signifying their dependence on power. If you look closer,
            you'll see that although they appear to be being imprisoned here
            against their will, the shackles around their necks are actually
            lose and could be taken off with ease. They all have tiny horns on
            their heads that resemble the devil's, a symbol that the longer they
            stay here, the more like him they will become. In addition to their
            shared tails, which are symbols of their primal inclinations and
            animalistic tendencies, the grapes and fire on each tail stand for
            the emotions of pleasure.
          </p>

          <h2>The Devil (Upright)</h2>
          <h3>Upright The Devil tarot card meaning</h3>
          <p>
            The Devil Tarot card can represent sadness or addiction in a generic
            sense. It might also indicate a sense of confinement or entrapment.
            This Major Arcana card in the tarot reading encourages a sense of
            being constrained by external forces or circumstances that are out
            of your control, leaving you feeling helpless and victimised. But
            The Devil conjures up an illusion like this. You are responsible for
            your own actions and are only constrained by the attitudes and
            behaviours you choose to display. Maintain your resolve and refuse
            to cede control. You are under no obligation to put up with anyone's
            negativity, criticism, trickery, or mistreatment.
          </p>
          <p>
            No matter how hopeless things may appear on the surface, you always
            have options and you can always take constructive steps to improve
            your position. Be conscious of how you treat others and make sure
            you are not attempting to manipulate or control anyone in your life.
            The upright Devil in your Tarot reading may also represent
            impetuous, compulsive, or secretive behaviour. It can be an
            indication that you are losing control. The Devil Tarot card may
            indicate that you have developed an unhealthy obsession with
            material possessions, status, or power. It is also a symbol of
            materialism. Put your focus on the things that will make you feel
            truly fulfilled as a person since these things won't.
          </p>

          <h3>Love and Relationship (Upright)</h3>
          <p>
            The Devil may indicate that you or your partner feels trapped if you
            are in a relationship. It might represent a loss of independence
            brought on by getting too involved in a romantic relationship. This
            degree of codependency is unhealthy, as the Devil demonstrates. Take
            a step back and work to rekindle some interests that aren't related
            to your relationship. It can also mean that you or your partner is
            experiencing relationship problems due to mental health problems. If
            so, get a competent counsellor to help you both through this
            difficult period. The Devil Tarot card can represent a variety of
            negative emotions, including abuse, dominance, deceit, and jealousy.
          </p>
          <p>
            In a love tarot reading, the Devil represents lust and temptation.
            With this card, there may be a sense of hedonism and a purely
            self-centered quest for satisfaction. It can also refer to just
            pursuing all of life's material pleasures under less dire
            situations. There is nothing wrong with having a little fun, but
            when you do it, be careful not to damage or mislead other people. It
            is up to you to let your dates know if you're merely searching for
            hookups. If someone decides your lifestyle isn't for them, be
            careful not to put pressure on them. The need for communication is
            greater than ever.
          </p>

          <h3>Finance (Upright)</h3>
          <p>
            Your diligent efforts to ensure that all of your bills are paid are
            indicated by The Devil Major Arcana tarot card. Things can be a bit
            tight right now, so you might need to perform a juggling act. This
            card might occasionally also indicate the necessity for you to make
            some crucial financial decisions. You probably currently find
            yourself on shaky ground as things seem to be very unpredictable.
            Since everything seems to change so suddenly, you could be very
            afraid to make that decision. You'll be able to handle this issue
            just well if you stay flexible. Ahead, this card in the tarot
            session indicates that you are trying to manage your finances,
            balance the books, or determine your income and expenses as well as
            your profit and loss.
          </p>
          <p>
            When this card shows up in your Tarot spread, you might be moving
            money bout to pay bills, and you should generally keep a watch on
            what's going in and out of your account. It may also mean that
            you're under a little stress or anxiety about having to make
            significant financial decisions. The issue can feel a little
            overwhelming right now, but you are resourceful, and if you remain
            adaptable to your surroundings, you will succeed. The Devil tarot
            card is a generally uplifting card that shows that, if you maintain
            composure and reason, any financial strain will only last a short
            while. You have chances to succeed, so take use of them.
          </p>

          <h3>Career (Upright)</h3>
          <p>
            If you pull the devil tarot in a career tarot reading, you may be
            managing several tasks at once. It's likely to be busier than usual
            at this time, and either things get thrown at you at the last minute
            that weren't supposed to be your duty or you've been taking them in
            order to advance your status. How much you can handle and how
            resourceful you are may astound those around you. This should only
            be a transient state, in theory. Keep an eye out to make sure you
            don't take on more work than you can handle or that your coworkers
            and managers don't start assigning you all the work that nobody
            wants to do.
          </p>
          <p>
            Make sure you receive enough compensation if this continues. This
            card occasionally also suggests striking a balance between your
            personal and professional objectives. The Devil card can indicate
            that you need to make a business decision in a job Tarot reading.
            For instance, you might be considering starting your own business or
            leaving your current, stable position in search of a new one, but
            you're not sure whether to take a chance or not. You cannot avoid
            risk in life; it is a part of everything worthwhile. All you can do
            is reduce the risk as much as you can before determining if it is
            worthwhile.
          </p>

          <h3>Health (Upright)</h3>
          <p>
            The Devil card suggests that you combine your personal and
            professional obligations with your health demands when it comes to
            your general well-being. Don't forget to set out time for both
            eating well and exercising. It is advised not to try to do too much
            too soon while beginning a new, healthy eating plan and exercise
            programme. Instead, it is advised that you ease yourself into these
            activities. The Devil card represents your efforts to achieve
            equilibrium in all spheres of your life, which will enable you to
            flourish and advance on your spiritual path. As you begin to
            understand the fulfilment a healthy mind, body, and spirit can
            bring, you shall realise that life is about more than just material
            wealth.
          </p>
          <p>
            Furthermore, this Major Arcana card also foretells that people must
            keep in mind that not everything is worth stressing. If you wish to
            set things right, make sure you play safe and keep proper track of
            your well-being. Natives getting this card (upright) must also be
            alert on roads. You might face some troubles and become prone to
            accidents. Moreover, sharp things around you can cause you harm.
            Also, if you are a health freak, the card could indicate some
            distractions. Thus, keep things in line as much as possible.
          </p>

          <h2>The Devil card (Reversed)</h2>
          <h3>Reversed Devil tarot card meaning</h3>
          <p>
            In the reversed position, the Devil card can indicate that you are
            attempting to juggle far too many different responsibilities in your
            life. To relieve the stress, you should at the very least take a
            brief pause. If you feel like you can't take everything, you should
            think about your own well-being and give yourself some breathing
            room. The reversal of the Devil card in your line of business can be
            auspicious. You will become overwhelmed if you commit to too many
            things. When the Devil card is upside down, it warns you that you
            are overcommitted and occasionally find it difficult to keep up with
            your busy schedule or pay your expenses.
          </p>
          <p>
            You might need to give your obligations greater structure by using
            budgets, to-do lists, advance planning, a diary, and efficient time
            management. Reject opportunities that no longer support your
            objectives. The Devil card in reverse can also mean that you are
            putting too much money into one aspect of your life to the detriment
            of others. The Devil card reversed can mean that you are trying to
            take on more than you can handle in general. It's conceivable that
            you're juggling too many tasks at once and are unable to maintain
            harmony in all of your life's spheres. This Minor Arcana card
            denotes feeling overextended, disorganisation, and feeling
            overwhelmed.
          </p>
          <p>
            Reversed, the Devil card can suggest that you are making bad
            decisions out of stress and may be getting yourself into more
            trouble than you need to. It can also mean that you need to prepare
            for inclement weather with backup plans. The Devil card' cons are
            personified when it is reversed. The continual unbalance is starting
            to overwhelm the juggler, who fumbles the coins. The Devil card
            invites you to look for imbalances in your own life and devise plans
            to correct them when you are upside down. To do this, discover
            techniques for lowering stress while relaxing your body and mind.
          </p>

          <h3>Love and Relationship (Reversed)</h3>
          <p>
            When the reversed Devil card occurs in a love tarot reading, you can
            find it challenging to maintain your balancing act. You might not
            even be aware that your partner is feeling neglected because of all
            the disputes and demands on you. There may be some animosity since
            it appears that everything is more important than they are because
            they feel that they are being ignored. If you're single, this card
            may indicate that you may need to choose between two potential
            partners or that you are now too busy and overworked to prioritise
            romance in your life. Take your time, and come back when you're
            prepared to create room for love in your hectic schedule.
          </p>
          <p>
            When the Devil card is reversed in a love tarot card, it can mean
            that you are trying to juggle too many things and aren't making time
            for your relationship. Your focus may be diverted from your
            relationship due to concerns with work, money, family, etc. Your
            relationship may be on the verge of disintegrating as a result of
            this stress, which may be resulting in conflicts and animosity. It
            may also allude to having to decide between two relationships. In
            other words, having an affair. If the Devil card is reversed and you
            are single, it may mean that you are too overburdened with
            obligations to devote the time necessary for a new relationship to
            blossom.
          </p>

          <h3>Finance (Reversed)</h3>
          <p>
            Resources could be limited, and it might feel like you can't seem to
            find out how to pay all your payments no matter what you try. Rent,
            groceries, utilities, and then all of a sudden, poof, it seems like
            money is spent as fast as it comes in. Unfortunately, this situation
            is not unusual. Examine your budget carefully, or make one if you
            don't already have one, to determine where you can make savings.
            Find a side project that can help you make some extra money, or ask
            for a raise. If you can, hiring a specialist to assist you in
            developing a plan may be advantageous to you. You must learn how to
            live within your means in terms of your cash.
          </p>
          <p>
            Since overspending may become a serious problem, especially when you
            are being pulled in a lot of different directions, the Devil card
            reversed interpretation advises you to be mindful of your income and
            outgoing expenses. The Devil card reversed is not a positive omen in
            a financial Tarot reading since it portends money losses and
            careless financial choices. It's possible that you just overspent
            and now realise that you wasted your money. Whatever the situation,
            it is pointless to mourn over spilled milk. All you have to do is
            start improving your decisions by learning from your past errors.
            Make a plan to pull yourself out of debt if you are in debt and seek
            professional guidance.
          </p>

          <h3>Career (Reversed)</h3>
          <p>
            The Devil card reversed in a career Tarot spread can suggest that
            you are overextending yourself and taking on too much. Failure is a
            sure thing when you try to juggle too many things at once, so set
            priorities and, if you can, delegate some of your workloads. You
            merely need to look for possibilities to lighten your workload or
            organise your workload. You could perhaps already be feeling the
            effects of taking on too much. If that's the case, accept that
            there's nothing you can do about the past other than to take what
            you've learned and go on.
          </p>
          <p>
            Rest, refocus, and then begin again, this time a little more
            systematically and wisely. There could be looming deadlines and
            constant pressure. You may be under a lot of stress right now
            because of your job. The time is now to advocate for yourself,
            solicit assistance, renegotiate deadlines, and prioritise your work.
            If you're not careful, items might slip through the cracks and cause
            you extra problems. The sooner your employer or coworkers realise
            that you are simply human, the better it will be for everyone.
          </p>

          <h3>Health (Reversed)</h3>
          <p>
            The Devil card reversed in a health context denotes that you may be
            pushing yourself too far in other spheres of your life, which could
            be harmful to your health. You may experience physical disease or
            injury as a result of having too many things on your plate, which
            can lead to severe stress and anxiety. If so, you should take some
            time to relax and reset. Just keep in mind that it's crucial to give
            your health the attention it requires; if you run yourself into the
            ground, you won't be any help to anyone. Reversed, the Devil card
            can suggest that you are not living in a balanced spiritual way,
            which might be hindering you from following your spiritual path.
          </p>
          <p>
            This could be a result of your excessive attention being drawn to
            your career, accumulating a fortune, or attempting to achieve
            everything. It could also be due to your overstretching yourself. To
            find harmony between your mind, body, and soul, you must carve aside
            time for yourself. Also, make sure things don't go downhill. If you
            are not into exercising, start as soon as possible. Avoid acting on
            things too much. Things will be great with the right efforts and
            attitude. Ignore the distractions that people or situations place in
            your path.
          </p>

          <h2>Devil card: One Card Pull</h2>
          <p>
            When you need concise, to-the-point solutions, only one card is
            pulled. It is used for situations where you need definite, Yes-or-No
            replies. Therefore, getting a one-card pull is usually beneficial if
            you are going through a difficult scenario or are trapped in a bind.
            After the card has been shuffled, you can pick one from the deck.
            You will receive the appropriate response to your query. The
            outcomes of one Devil card pull are as follows:
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Upright Position:</strong> When the Devil card appears as an
            answer to your query, it is recommended to interpret it as a "maybe"
            rather than a definite "yes" or "no." This tarot card is the
            quintessential illustration of the necessity for balance and
            consideration of all available possibilities. You will eventually
            see the definitive solution.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Reversed Position:</strong> The Devil card in reversed
            position is most effectively read as a resounding "no" to your
            inquiry. There is too much going on, which is currently causing a
            feeling of overload. Eliminating things that no longer serve you is

          <h2>Devil Card for Timing</h2>
          <p>
            The Devil card foretells that a crucial idea of dedication to
            success will be put into practise. This incident could happen in the
            upcoming weeks or years. If you draw the Devil card in response to a
            query about the time of an event, it indicates that your wishes or
            questions will come true. Even so, it will take time because an
            Earth element denotes growth, although slow and steady growth.

            It would be difficult to say how soon that is because it may be
            autumn or a zodiac sign season for Taurus, Virgo, or Capricorn. It
            can also be counted in months, or around the 2nd, 20th, or 29th, of
            a month. Keeping in mind that whatever you are inquiring about is
            arriving slowly but definitely, you should interpret this in a way
            that allows you to determine the time. The ideal method for
            determining the time while using the Pentacles Suit is to always
            assume two to three months in the future.
