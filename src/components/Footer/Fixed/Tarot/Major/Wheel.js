          <h3>Wheel of Fortune Tarot Card Description</h3>
          <p>
            If you draw the Wheel of Fortune tarot card, then beep beep!!
            Significant life changes are going to come your way. The Wheel of
            Fortune card is number 10 of the Major Arcana cards in the deck of
            tarot cards. The Wheel of Fortune tarot card is ruled by Jupiter,
            the planet of good fortune, expansion, and progress. The card
            reminds us that change is inevitable and the only constant thing in
            life. The showing-up of the card is a reminder that you are either
            holding too tight onto something or just delaying your progress by
            ignoring the signals coming from your consciousness. The Wheel of
            Fortune card wants you to let go to understand your role in this
            life and the universe.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Wheel of Fortune card has a giant wheel on display with three
            figures oozing on the outer edges. The Wheel on the card has the
            letters TORA, which astrologers think to be a version of the word
            Torah, meaning 'law' or TAROT, or even ROTA (Latin for 'wheel'). The
            middle wheel of the Wheel of fortune card represents the four
            elements of life. Against the outer circle of the wheel are a snake
            and the God of Evil, Typhon, on the right and left side,
            respectively. The snake on the card represents the life force
            plunging into the material world. On the other hand, the Egyptian
            God of evil welcomes souls to the underworld.
          </p>
          <p>
            The top of the wheel has the Sphinx sitting on it, which represents
            knowledge and strength. On the four corners of the card are four
            winged creatures, each associated with four Zodiac signs, Aquarius,
            Scorpio (eagle), Leo (Lion), and Taurus (Bull). Their wings signify
            stability amidst movement and change, and each holds the Torah,
            representing wisdom.
          </p>

          <h2>Wheel of fortune Tarot Card (Upright)</h2>
          <h3>Upright Wheel of fortune Tarot Card meaning</h3>
          <p>
            Pulling the Wheel of Fortune card upright is an indicator that
            changes are going to come your way soon, and most of the time, it is
            the positive change we are talking about. These changes can entirely
            redo your life from being a mess you complain about to an experience
            to cherish. However, you need to remember that not all changes are
            easy, and may want you to sacrifice something. Also, some sacrifices
            you make may feel unfair at first, but in the long run, they will
            serve the greater good for you.
          </p>
          <p>
            Most of the time, we know what we need to do in life to achieve
            greatness, yet we refrain from doing those things just because we
            are either lazy or too occupied with other stuff that is serving no
            purpose in making our life better whatsoever. Other times, it is the
            situation not being in our favour, which refrains us from achieving
            more. The Wheel of Fortune card is a signal that the universe is
            working in your favour and will certainly help you reach your goals
            if you are willing to take even a pinch of effort.
          </p>
          <p>
            India's best tarot readers claim that if you have pulled the Wheel
            of fortune card upright, make sure you make the most of the
            opportunities the world is offering you. Know that it's time to
            focus on yourself and make plans about things you want to
            accomplish. If you do so, you will truly achieve things faster than
            anyone around, be it taking a startup towards success or simply
            cracking a government exam. The Wheel of Fortune also represents the
            ever-changing cycles of life. If there is happiness, there will be
            periods of dismay too. It basically depends on your karma.
          </p>

          <h3>Love and Relationships (Upright)</h3>
          <p>
            If you are in a relationship with someone or simply want to propose
            to someone any time soon, the Wheel of Fortune card in the upright
            position is a sign that things will go in your favour, and you can,
            without a doubt, take the next step in your relationship. Also, if
            you are not content in a relationship or simply wish to move on, the
            Wheel of Fortune card is a sign that you might want to give it a
            last try. The card surely doesn't stop you from ending a
            relationship if you wish to do so (as it is a part of the change)
            but only signals that good things will happen in your love life with
            or without your current partner.
          </p>
          <p>
            For the single natives, the Wheel of Fortune card in the upright
            position is a signal that the universe is working to bring you the
            love you deserve. However, being an introvert will not help you have
            it. Some of us are really shy about love and may not approach
            others, but that doesn't mean no one wants to approach us either.
            You have good fortune coming in love, so now is the time to put
            yourself out at least on display. This will be a new experience and
            change that the card represents. As the Wheel of Fortune is also a
            card of destiny, it also signifies soulmates. Hence, if you are
            single, you may be meeting yours soon.
          </p>

          <h3>Finances (Upright)</h3>
          <p>
            Financially, pulling out the Wheel of Fortune Upright is not the
            best indication, especially if you spend a lot and have hard
            time-saving money. If you have been consistently comfortable
            money-wise, the Wheel of Fortune card is a signal that things may
            change for you from here on. Unexpected expenses may come your way.
            Hence make sure you put something by for a time when you may need
            it. Cut your useless expenses and make investments that you would be
            proud of going forward.
          </p>
          <p>
            On the other hand, if you are experiencing any kind of financial
            difficulties, the Upright Wheel of Fortune Tarot card is an
            indicator that things are going to improve for you in terms of
            finance. You will be lucky to make the right investment decisions
            alongside having opportunities to earn from multiple resources.
          </p>

          <h3>Career (Upright)</h3>
          <p>
            In terms of Career, the wheel of fortune works as a sign that new
            opportunities are waiting ahead of you. If you have been wanting to
            start your business, this is the right time to consider the chances
            as the universe is conspiring and helping you to make such big
            changes. One looking for a new job must look harder now. However,
            most of us are even happy and content with our career status. For
            them, too, the Wheel of Fortune is an indicator that either change
            is coming for you or you must make some for yourself to further
            progress in life.
          </p>
          <p>
            Also, not each of these changes will be easy. One may even question
            one's capability to do a particular task being offered with a high
            pay scale. It is advised you give everything a try, and you will see
            things falling in place for you, and change will not be as scary as
            you think.
          </p>

          <h3>Health (Upright)</h3>
          <p>
            Again, having pulled the Wheel of Fortune card in the upright
            position means change will happen for you in terms of health too. In
            fact, the card is a signal that if you have been dealing with health
            issues lately, the wheel may start to turn in your favour. As the
            nature of the card changes, healthy people need to be more careful
            here and make adjustments in life accordingly.
          </p>
          <p>
            For example, if you have been too busy pushing yourself mentally,
            emotionally, and physically. Then maybe, you might bump into a bout
            of illness that may put a handbrake on your progress. If you don't
            wish that to happen, try listening and taking out time for yourself.
            Invest in hobbies, eat well, and make positive adjustments that are
            kind to your body and health.
          </p>

          <h2>Wheel of fortune Tarot Card (Reversed)</h2>
          <h3>Reversed Wheel of fortune Tarot Card meaning</h3>
          <p>
            The Wheel of Fortune tarot card in the reversed position still
            denotes change but one that you might not want to welcome with open
            arms. The reversed Wheel of Fortune card is an indicator that
            difficult changes are awaiting you ahead, and if you don't prepare
            for them, things might get fishy, as you will have a tough time
            adjusting to them.
          </p>
          <p>
            Many times, we feel that things have suddenly begun to fall apart
            for us, and pulling out this card confirms the fact. The sudden
            changes can leave you powerless, giving you a feeling that you no
            longer have any control over your life or emotions. However, the
            tarot readers claim that these unwelcome changes are rather a result
            of one's personal decisions and not any external forces working
            against you.
          </p>
          <p>
            Hence, when you see the reversed Wheel of Fortune tarot card, it is
            advised that you take ownership of your choices and make
            well-informed decisions.
          </p>
          <p>
            Discussing your decisions with your loved ones is one way to lead
            yourself in the right direction. However, always remember one thing,
            whatever happens, you must not resist change and let it take its
            course. The more you allow yourself to change as per the will of the
            dominant force, the more you will learn about life. These ups and
            downs are part of life and often we learn more from hardship than we
            do from good fortune.
          </p>

          <h3>Love and Relationships (Reversed)</h3>
          <p>
            In the love context, pulling out the Wheel of Fortune tarot card in
            reversed position means that your relationship can go haywire from
            here. Scary? Well, it is but this doesn't mean that you suddenly
            make a knee-jerk, call things off and not try to ask out your
            childhood crush on a date. But instead, the card signifies how all
            relationships have their share of ups and downs, and this is the
            down phase of yours, which you need to tackle. For many people, the
            hiccups are about moving from one phase of the relationship to
            another, which is slightly uncomfortable. Nevertheless, whatever the
            reason behind the fallout, try to think about it and make a fair
            decision accordingly. In this period, you can even think of giving
            your relationship a break or your partner some extra space.
          </p>
          <p>
            Another reason behind your relationship going haywire could be that
            previous mistakes may spawn back due to some current action of
            yours. If you are single and having a tough time finding love, it is
            suggested that you look back at your own choices to think if you
            have thrown away opportunities in love? If it is so, learn from your
            mistakes and take another shot at love. If you really want love to
            fall into your lap despite pulling the reversed Wheel of Fortune
            tarot card, then it is a must that you look out for people who are
            compatible with you rather than just falling for the way they look.
            Always remember that the Wheel of Fortune Tarot card in a reversed
            position will deal with things for you, but you need not get
            depressed because of the setbacks and try to go with the flow.
          </p>

          <h3>Finances (Reversed)</h3>
          <p>
            Financially, in this period, try not to do things that you will
            regret. Just like gambling or spending too much money. Also, not
            just the stuff your mother won't appreciate, but one also needs to
            take care of their investments and not try to take financial risks.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the midst, if you feel a bit of a financial pinch, the trump card
            would be to save up some money for your financial safety. The
            hardship in terms of finances, just like any other thing, will not
            last forever but will be a lesson to remember.
          </p>

          <h3>Career (Reversed)</h3>
          <p>
            When it comes to career, the reversed Wheel of Fortune tarot card
            indicates a period of either stagnation or disruption in the career
            of the native. The disruption can be either because of your
            unwillingness to welcome change or because you are too worked up and
            need to rest for a while. This Major Arcana card, in its reverse
            form, signals that the natives need to assess the decisions he has
            made recently and whether they need to juggle them around.
          </p>
          <p>
            Also, the card wants you to focus on whether you have seized the
            better opportunities available around you or not? If not, then you
            might want to rethink your career choices for your own good. All in
            all, remember that all of this is temporary and shall pass. However,
            the disruption will come, both as an opportunity and a blessing for
            you.
          </p>

          <h3>Health (Reversed)</h3>
          <p>
            As harsh as it may sound, have you pulled the revered Wheel of
            Fortune card for yourself, it is a signal that you may experience
            disruption in another area of life, i.e., health. In this time of
            life, consider giving your "I will get healthy" new year resolution
            a try by investing in a morning run or simply hitting a gym on a
            regular basis. Also, try not to take stress, which may be hard
            knowing the fact that many other things in your life - as discussed
            above - might not be going well for you.
          </p>
          <p>
            You simply need to remember that things fall upon places anyways.
            Also, as you hint at disruption in your life, don't try to stop
            events from happening but make positive steps to take care of
            yourself and your body even through the tough times, and your health
            will benefit.
          </p>
