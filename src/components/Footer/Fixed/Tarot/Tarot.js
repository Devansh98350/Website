          <h3>Tarot Calculators</h3>
          <p>
            Tarot reading is a powerful form of divination that use an ancient
            deck of cards to help you find answers to your questions about your
            love, relationships, career, wellness and more.
          </p>
          <h3>How to read the tarot cards?</h3>
          <p>
            Together these two decks—Major and Minor Arcana, form a
            comprehensive and pictorial picture. It is vital to keep in mind
            that all the solutions we wish to know lie innately within these two
            tarot card decks. They depict strongly an individual, situation, or
            potential outcome. As there are no hidden motives or puzzles in the
            tarot cards reading, the power to discern their meaning lies within
            the person’s narrative and interpretation.
          </p>
          <p>
            Before any tarot cards reading, make sure to clear the deck by
            shuffling it properly. Also, this deliberate action must become a
            meditation for the tarot reader. You must feel and understand the
            physicality of the tarot cards in your hand. While doing so, you
            must visualise your question properly and clearly. If you are
            performing tarot card reading for someone else, you must utilise
            this reflective time to dig deeper into the roots of their
            circumstance and situation. This shall help you form particular
            queries about them.
          </p>
          <p>
            You can take as long as you need but remember to focus and meditate
            properly. Whenever you are good to go, divide the cards into three
            parts and reorder the pile facing down. Then, on a nice clean cloth,
            prepare the cards for the spread and pull cards to get the answer to
            the questions running through the head.
          </p>
          <p>
            Though all the cards have their own classic association, the
            strongest source behind the right predictions is your intuition.
            Your immediate emotional reaction towards the card you drew makes
            all the rightful patterns and systems, allowing you to form a better
            narrative and understanding of the circumstances.
