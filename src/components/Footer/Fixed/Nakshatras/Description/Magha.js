              career if she is educated enough. In fact, if the planet Jupiter
              finds a place in this nakshatra at the time of your birth, then no
              one can stop you from enjoying a successful profession and a
              lavish life. This placement of Jupiter allows the woman a very
              high post in her professional life. The effect of Jupiter is such
              that wealth gets attracted to her from all sides. She is also
              likely to get married to a very rich man and will lead a luxurious

              your husband. If you wish to counter such traits, you must try to
              fall in love and likely have a love marriage. As a person, you are
              very smart and transfer such qualities to your kids, thus ensuring
