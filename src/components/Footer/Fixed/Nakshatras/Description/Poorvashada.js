            <h2>Male Characteristics</h2>
            <p>
              Purvashada nakshatra males are very intelligent and intuitive.
              They claim themselves to be brave and courageous but when the time
              comes, they usually don't move forward and behave in a courageous
              manner. There are times when they will not have any other option
              but to do something out of their comfort zone, to get out of a
              difficult situation. They get easily swayed by other people's
              persuasion and agree to do things that will later harm them,
              although they are bad at making big decisions. Males of this
              nakshatra usually have a very sharp tongue and know how to use it
              when in an argument. So it is hard to win any fight against them.
            </p>

            <h3>Profession</h3>
            <p>
              The males of this nakshatra are intelligent and smart. So
              accordingly, they can easily become a doctor or even a surgeon.
              But that doesn't mean that they cannot go for any other field. In
              fact, they will find success in any profession they choose, and
              everything is suitable for them. But they must be careful if they
              choose to be a businessman and only move forward if they have
              people around them who they wholeheartedly trust and believe. They
              will also gain an interest in occult studies. Before and around
              the age of 32, they will find it difficult to maintain stability
              in their career, but as they reach the age of 50, they will
              gradually build a stable and steady life.
            </p>

            <h3>Compatibility</h3>
            <p>
              There is not much compatibility when it comes to their parents for
              these Purvashadha nakshatra males, but they will have good
              relationships with their brothers and sisters. They are chance
              that they will spend most of their lives in foreign countries.
              Though they might get married later than their peers, they will
              have a happy and healthy married life with some minor
              disagreements here and there with their spouse. Unlike their
              parents, they will have a very close relationship with their
              parents-in-law. They will also be lucky when it comes to their
              children as their children are going to be intelligent and make
              name for the family.
            </p>

            <h3>Health</h3>
            <p>
              The health of these males will generally be good in the earlier
              period of their life, although they will always have a knacking
              feeling that not everything is as good as it seems. And
              accordingly, they will catch an illness that will take time to
              heal. This illness will not affect their lifestyle and work
              performance.
