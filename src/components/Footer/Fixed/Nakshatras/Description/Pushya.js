            <h2>Male Characteristics</h2>
            <p>
              Male natives born in Pushya Nakshatra are old school romantics
              with a hidden emotional character that debars them from making
              tough life decisions. These people find it tough to leave someone
              and thus are loyal lovers. These people also struggle at making
              tough changes in life. The emotional nature of these natives,
              however, also makes them kind-hearted. This native is always in
              the mood to please himself and hence, can be selfish about it. The
              Pushya male has a chosen few friends and doesn't pay much heed to
              people beyond that circle. Praise inflates his ego, while
              criticism deflates it. The soft nature of these individuals makes
              them malleable to falling into the wrong company. Hence, males
              born in Pushya Nakshatra must be very careful about who they forge
              bonds with, be it personal or professional.

              of handling them. Yet, having too much work under their selves
              make them stressed and uninterested in other commitments in life.
              Also, as these males are emotional beings, even a little criticism
              about their work can make them sad. These natives, however, don't
              like to leave any task in between if they have once committed
              themselves to it. Aka, the male born in Pushya Nakshatra is born
