            <h2>Male Characteristics</h2>
            <p>
              Males born in Purva Bhadrapada nakshatra are soft-spoken and
              peace-loving people. They have very strict values, which they
              follow religiously and it agitates them when others do something
              totally opposite. Though they are not the most religious people,
              they are very humble in nature and are always ready to fight on
              others' behalf if they ever encounter unfairness. They will get
              angry if they are slighted in any way and love a simple life free
              of complications. They have a very kind soul and help those in
              need, but for one reason or the other, they always create
              misunderstandings which ultimately leave them unloved. People do
              respect them a lot even if they are not always financially strong.

              mothers will always be on shaky grounds. The reason behind the
