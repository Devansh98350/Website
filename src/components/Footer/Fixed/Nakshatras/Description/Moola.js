            <h2>Male Characteristics</h2>
            <p>
              The male native born in Moola Nakshatra values time specifically
              and is always working to create a peaceful environment for himself
              and the people around him. The male also has a tendency to do
              everything on his own, which, at times, makes him vulnerable and
              way occupied with additional things in life. The male native is
              also too worried about the future, which is something that stops
              him from choosing anything else apart from the hustle. In fact,
              the native is too influenced by the people around him. Within, the
              native is a God-fearing individual and lives with a belief that
              God would take care of everything for him. However, the belief
              doesn't stop him from working hard.
            </p>

            <h3>Profession</h3>
            <p>
              The male native born in Moola Nakshatra is prone to debt traps as
              he has a tough time managing his finances. Hence the best idea for
              him is to save as much as he can. In fact, when it comes to
              managing finances, and even other things in life, he is good at
              advising others but is not capable of following the same advice
              himself. Talking about money, the native earns through multiple
              sources. Also, he may change his profession multiple times in his
              life. After 25 years of age, it is the best idea for you to stay
              away from friends who are extravagant by nature, as in their
              company, you too may end up spending more than you can afford.
            </p>

            <h3>Compatibility</h3>
            <p>
              The male native born in Moola Nakshatra loves his close ones more
              than anything else. However, at times, he is either not able to
              show that feeling or doesn't have the time to, which may make him
              feel disconnected from his family. Talking about family, the
              native is unlikely to get any benefits from his parents and is a
              self-made man. He is very helpful when it comes to managing and
              raising his children. Also, as the native thinks of the future, he
              is a good planner.
            </p>

            <h3>Health</h3>
            <p>
              The male native born in Moola Nakshatra may have to deal with
              symptoms that can lead to tuberculosis, paralysis, or persistent
              stomach problems. The ages at which the native needs to take
              special care of her health are 27, 31, 44, 48, 56, and 60 years.

          <section className="female-section">
            <h2>Female Characteristics</h2>
            <p>
              The female native born in Moola Nakshatra is a pure-hearted
              person. The ladies will go any height for people who they love.
              This nature sometimes messes things up for them as people tend to
              use their goodwill for personal benefits. Hence you need to be
              cautious of who you call friends. Besides the good, the female
              born in Moola Nakshatra can also be very stubborn, just like a
              bull. This may show her in a bad light but she, certainly, knows
              how to use her stubbornness for her good. Her stubbornness is
              something that makes her achieve greater things in life, but
              coupling it with jealousy can lead to a disaster. The female may
              have to go through multiple heartbreaks in her life.
            </p>

            <h3>Profession</h3>
            <p>
              The female native born in Moola Nakshatra generally has a tough
              time garnering education for herself. This is certainly due to her
              less concentration on studies and more concentration on other
              artistic and social things in life. However, at times when Jupiter
              is placed favourably in the Moola Nakshatra, that is one good time
              to start anything related to education as Jupiter will help you in
              pursuing it. The lady born in Moola Nakshatra also does well in
              medical-related jobs.
            </p>

            <h3>Compatibility</h3>
            <p>
              The female native born in Moola Nakshatra always has a danger of
              separation hovering over him. This could be due to her husband's
              rebellious nature. The lady born in Moola Nakshatra seeks a lot of
              attention from people close to her, and she can very quickly get
              upset about not getting it. However, on the positive side,
              favourably placed planets can mitigate the hindrances in her
              marriage. Pleasing Mars for a happy married life is something she
              can try apart from talking out the problems with her husband as
              well as her children.
            </p>

            <h3>Health</h3>
            <p>
              The female native born in Moola Nakshatra may have to deal with
              stomach problems. She will have to be particularly careful in the
              following years of her age: 27, 31, 38, 56, and 60.
