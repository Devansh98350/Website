            <p>
              The female born in Swati Nakshatra is very outgoing, social and
              compassionate about her goals in life. However, these modern
              qualities within her don't stop her from being religious, as she
              is also a God-fearing pious human. The lady - despite being social
              - struggles at making new friends. The same goes when finding a
              partner, as she takes her time to make the right choices when it
              comes to relationships. But when in love, she is very loyal and
              honest and won't hurt you even if you are the first to hurt them.

              lesson and believes in moving on. Also, she doesn't like
              travelling much and prefers to stay at home as much as possible.
            </p>

            <h3>Profession</h3>
            <p>

              imagine when it comes to her professional life. If she works
              dedicatedly, the nakshatra favours her by allowing her more name
              and fame in her profession than she could ever imagine. However,
              the lady born in this nakshatra will have to struggle quite a bit
              to acquire an education. She may also have to drop out, such a
              scenario will only delay and not take success away from her. Any
              job that requires a lot of travelling is suitable for the female
              born in Swati Nakshatra even though she does not like travelling
              much.

              family. This love often could lead her to make compromises that
              she doesn't want to. This can make her distressed but the love and
              affection she gets from her children more than makes up for it.
              However, some share of the compromises must lie upon your husband
              too. Talking about husband, you two will have average
              compatibility and will be able to forge a sound and happy
