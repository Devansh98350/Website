            <h2>Male Characteristics</h2>
            <p>
              Males born in Purva Phalguni Nakshatra tend to have a very
              prosperous career in whichever field they choose to take. They
              will have a successful life in terms of their profession but there
              are also chances where they will have to face some kind of mental
              disturbance because of various issues. They love their
              independence and freedom, and will not take lightly on those who
              try to take their freedom away from them. Males of this nakshatra
              are very soft-spoken and they possess the power of intuition which
              they will use for the benefit of others. They also love to travel.
            </p>

            <h3>Profession</h3>
            <p>
              Purva Phalguni males do not like to work under someone else, so
              jobs, where they have to answer to their superiors, will not be
              the best choice of profession for them. Because of this nature,
              their hard work will mostly be unappreciated by their superiors
              and they will be unliked by them, which will ultimately result in
              them not getting promotions and a delay in their success. They are
              more prone to having enemies which they are not aware of, causing
              them difficulties in their career, even when these males are very
              honest human beings and will never try to gain success by
              sacrificing someone else. Males of this nakshatra are very
              intelligent, hence even if someone tries to cheat or plot against
              them, they will easily overcome it. They are more likely to
              venture into different jobs until the age of 45 and after that,
              they will be fairly satisfied with their place. Chances are that
              people will try to cheat them financially, so they should avoid
              lending money to others.
            </p>

            <h3>Compatibility</h3>
            <p>
              In terms of married life, male born in this nakshatra will be
              fairly lucky to have loving children and a loving wife. His wife
              will be a good housewife and h will have a very good connection
              with her leading a healthy and happy life. Unfortunately, there
              might be instances where he might not end up with the person he
              loves but that doesn't mean he will have an unhappy marriage. They
              are more likely to live away from their birthplace and their
              family.
            </p>

            <h3>Health</h3>
