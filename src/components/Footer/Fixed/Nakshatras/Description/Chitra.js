            <h2>Male Characteristics</h2>
            <p>
              The male born in Chitra Nakshatra is a nature lover. These people
              are also very intelligent and use the trait to explore things that
              can give them profit of any kind. The male likes to be ahead of
              everyone else and, hence, never misses the opportunity to try
              something new for himself. His suggestions and ideas are
              well-thought, thus winning his praises both in his personal and
              professional life. As the person is artistic, he is able to make a
              good first impression on others, especially on the opposite
              gender. The male native is a good partner and cares for even the
              smallest need of each and everyone around him. However, when life
              is not treating him well, he may get rude at even the ones close
              to him.
            </p>

            <h3>Profession</h3>
            <p>
              As far as the profession goes, the male born in Chitra Nakshatra
              is very hardworking but yet has to struggle till the age of 32 to
              find success for himself. However, once he crosses this age, he
              will find success in multiple endeavours. In fact, the native,
              after crossing the age of 33, will see himself getting rewards
              from unexpected quarters and that too without striving too much.
              The best professions for the male born in the Chitra Nakshatra are
              architecture, engineering, pilot and anything related to
              travelling. If in business, the native will earn well in a
              partnership or even if he works with his parents.
            </p>

            <h3>Compatibility</h3>
            <p>
              The male native born in the Chitra Nakshatra is more compatible
              with his siblings than anyone else. When it comes to his wife, the
              native is quite suspicious by nature, which may become the reason
              for stiffness in the relationship of the couple. Though the
              relationship will be stable, there will be frequent friction with
              his spouse. It is to his credit that all through life he shoulders
              a lot of responsibilities and yet gets criticised for them without
              complaining.
            </p>

            <h3>Health</h3>
            <p>
              The male native born in the Chitra Nakshatra may have to deal with
              major health problems after the age of 25. This is because he
              doesn't take much care of his heath. Problems in the kidney and
              bladder are quite common for people born in this Nakshatra.
            </p>
          </section>

          <section className="female-section">
            <h2>Female Characteristics</h2>
            <p>
              The female born in Chitra Nakshatra is too fond of her freedom.
              She is of a forward nature and tired of being told what she should
              be doing and what she shouldn't. However, her craving for freedom
              has less authenticity as she usually enjoys the freedom she
              desires only after the age of 25. However, once she has her
              freedom, she needs to be careful of falling prey to sinful
              activities, as females born in Chitra Nakshatra are more prone to
              getting indulged in sinful deeds. The situation can be countered
              by ensuring that you make friends carefully. Talking about
              friends, the woman here may have very few friends but all of them
              will be very helpful.
            </p>

            <h3>Profession</h3>
            <p>
              As far as the profession goes, the female native born in the
              Chitra Nakshatra does good in medical-related fields such as
              doctor or nurse. Apart from this, the lady has favourable chances
              of becoming an actress or a model or an influencer too. Whatever
              the lady does, she does it with full dedication and is able to get
              the desired results out of it. Astrologers are of the opinion that
              the female born in the Chitra Nakshatra is very lucky for her
              husband too and should be made a part of it for professional
              prosperity.
            </p>

            <h3>Compatibility</h3>
            <p>
              The female native born in the Chitra Nakshatra must ensure that
              her horoscope is matched well with the boy before she gets married
              to him. The matching if not done can lead to fatal worries for the
              couple going forward. Also, there are chances of sexual
              incompatibility between you and your spouse which can be rectified
              only if you both are open about it. The lady has to be more
              dedicated in the relationship if she wants it to work.
            </p>

            <h3>Health</h3>
            <p>
              The female born in the Chitra Nakshatra, just like males, may have
              to deal with major health problems after the age of 25. This is
              because he doesn't take much care of his health. Problems in the
              kidney and bladder are quite common for people born in this
              Nakshatra.
