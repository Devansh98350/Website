          <section className="male-section">
            <h2>Male Characteristics</h2>
            <p>
              Male belonging to this nakshatra is the kind to doubt every
              action, and that too is for a legitimate reason as he had
              previously been cheated on by people close to him. Trust is
              something he does not do very easily and that is for his own good.
              Although, even if he has been conned by the people around him, he
              does not directly cut them off from his life but rather acts nice
              but wary around them. He is someone who is always invested in a
              conversation and is paying attention to every word that is being
              spoken and is expecting the same from others. Mrigashira male
              doesn't like to be around people who are judgemental or people he
              finds to be dishonest. However, males of this nakshatra may not be
              as truthful to themselves as they think they are, as they are
              someone who is different from the person they project themselves
              to be to the world.
            </p>

            <h3>Profession</h3>
            <p>
              Mrigashira males give very good advice when it comes to financial
              matters but somehow fail to follow the same - the reason why they
              might usually find themselves in a situation of crisis. They are
              usually very well educated and will do good in the field of
              business. His business will bloom during the age of 32 and he will
              find himself in a financial place he is satisfied with between the
              age of 33 to 50, full of energy.
            </p>

            <h3>Compatibility</h3>
            <p>
              Although there will be immense love between him and his spouse,
              there will always be animosity in the relationship due to petty
              reasons and differences in opinion. The reason for most of the
              conflicts between him and his wife will be because one or the
              other has a higher profession, which will cause an inferiority
              complex among them.
            </p>

            <h3>Health</h3>
            <p>
              Male of this nakshatra might have to go through some medical
              ailment during his childhood such as frequent constipation leading
              to a digestive disorder, cuts and injuries along with chronic
              shoulder or collarbone pain.

            <h2>Female Characteristics</h2>
            <p>
              Females of Mrigashira Nakshatra are not someone to be trifled with
              since they tend to have a sharp tongue and love to speak their
              mind. During an argument, they must be careful and watch what they
              are saying as any mishap or curse word may cause serious damage to
              the other person. They are smart and witty and can be a little
              selfish on some occasions. They love to do social work and are
              very fond of fine arts. In the future, one might find them settled
              with loving children and a devoted husband with wealth surrounding
              them as they are indeed very fond of money and wealth.
            </p>

            <h3>Profession</h3>
            <p>
              Mrigashira females are usually intelligent but unfortunately, they
              are not the ones who are very keen on having a good education. But
              their lack of interest in studies may lead to them repeating a
              class multiple times. Although, there might be a change in
              interest in them when Jupiter is well aligned with the Magha
              constellation, which may lead to them doing their best in
              education as well as profession.
            </p>

            <h3>Compatibility</h3>
            <p>

              household chores even after long into her marriage. Due to their
              wild nature, they might end up having a few love affairs during
              the early period of her marriage but they will soon redeem her
              mistakes and have a loving marriage later on.
            </p>

            <h3>Health</h3>
            <p>
              Health is a very serious thing for females of Mrigashira Nakshatra
              as they may have to suffer from some serious health issues such as
