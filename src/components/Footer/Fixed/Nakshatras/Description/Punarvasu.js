            <h2>Male Characteristics</h2>
            <p>
              Males born in Punarvasu Nakshatra are believed to be very
              spiritual and religious. They tend to have a good nature and
              behaviour when they are young, but as they grow up, they slowly
              start adopting a more crass and arrogant behaviour. As they become
              an adult, they slowly become less likeable, and because of this,
              being friends with them can be a little stress-inducing. They can
              sometimes crave for something they cannot have, but they can't be
              called materialistic as they are generally satisfied with what
              they already have. Something that is non-negotiable for them is
              illegal activities, and neither would they do it themselves nor
              would they allow someone close to them to do it. Along with that,
              they can be very generous and helpful to others.
            </p>

            <h3>Profession</h3>
            <p>
              Punarvasu male can not work in any business where he will have to
              partner up with someone as he is a lone wolf, hence why he won't
              be able to gain success in the field of business. Other than that,
              they will gain success in being a teacher or a stage performer
              being the most suitable for them. Till the age of 32, they should
              become more careful when making important decisions because of
              unfavourable stars. Because of their honesty, success in business
              and making wealth is very hard for them.
            </p>

            <h3>Compatibility</h3>
            <p>
              Punarvasu male has great respect and regards for their parents and
              teachers but having a fulfilling marriage is hard for them.
              Chances of a failed marriage and second marriage are high for
              them, and frustration and anxiety regarding their spouse's health
              may cause them an unhappy life. There might also be frequent
              disagreements with other family members, which might ultimately
              cause them mental health issues.
            </p>

            <h3>Health</h3>
            <p>
              Males of this nakshatra are one of the healthiest of all as they
              have a very strong digestive system and tend to drink a lot of
              water and take care of themselves. Although they get concerned
              about their health with the most subtle signs of illness.

              resentment against her. But deep inside, she has a heart of gold
              and knows to show respect to whoever she feels is deserving. She
              likes to live in comfort, hence she will have all forms of
