            <h2>Male Characteristics</h2>
            <p>
              The male native-born in the Ardra Nakshatra is the responsible
              kind. He has a general tendency to accomplish any given task at
              the earliest. The native, however, must ensure that he keeps this
              quality hidden if he doesn't wish to get overburdened in life.
              Though we make the male born in Ardra Nakshatra sound like a nerd,
              but he is not just that. In fact, being humorous is one of the
              things these people are good at. However, they first need to be
              comfortable around you to bring out their funny side. With friends
              and relatives, he will behave in an amicable way, but on rare
              occasions, he may be thankless to people who do him a favour.
            </p>

            <h3>Profession</h3>
            <p>

              sharp memory. Hence, these people do well in jobs that require a
              lot of thinking, such as writing, engineering, etc. However, the
              males born in this Nakshatra don't usually stick to one
              profession. They like to try everything before dedicating
              themselves to one single profession. Also, these people are quick
              learners and thus able to adapt themselves to changing work
              situations faster than anyone else. It is good for these males if
              they work away from home, especially during their career-peak age,
              i.e. between 32 to 42.

              The delay in marriage is majorly due to you not being able to find
              a compatible partner. Any marriage that takes place before the age
              of 27 for you will bring complications, which may result in
              separation too. Compatibility should be the key when you go out to
              choose who you want to get married to and not the looks of the
              person if you wish to have a successful married life. In family
              life, you may feel like you are the most ignored one among your
              siblings.
            </p>

              serious complications. Any symptoms that can leads to asthma, dry
              cough or hearing impairment must be well-tracked.

              changes once you tie the knot. You will have a romantic partner
              and good sexual compatibility. In family life, you will be much
              pulled towards your mother and then mother in law. Both of them
              will bring comfort to your life.
