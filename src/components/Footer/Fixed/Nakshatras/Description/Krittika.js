            <h2>Male Characteristics</h2>
            <p>
              The man born in Krittika Nakshatra has a thirst for knowledge yet
              is impatient in life. He has a tendency to do everything at once
              and in doing so, sometimes ends up messing up things for himself.
              Yet, the male is good with advice and thus is a great friend or
              guide to have. Yet, even as a friend, you are not allowed to
              suggest or prohibit him from doing his own thing as he wouldn't
              like it. The native born in Krittika Nakshatra has an exceptional
              ability to make money and is business-minded. However, to progress
              in life, he must be determined to take risks.
            </p>

            <h3>Profession</h3>
            <p>
              As far as the profession goes, the male born in Krittika Nakshatra
              has a natural inclination to stay away from home for work
              purposes. In fact, these people do well in life if they stay away
              from family for professional reasons. The natural and most-suited
              profession for these males is business related to yarn export,
              pharmaceuticals, and handicraft items. When it comes to a desk
              job, engineering, apart from anything related to medical, bodes
              well for these natives.
            </p>

            <h3>Compatibility</h3>
            <p>
              The phrase, 'behind every successful man, there is a strong
              woman', bodes well for the males born in the Kritika Nakshatra as
              they usually get lucky once they get married. Both the wife and
              the male can do a lot together to make their life fulfilling.
              However, the life of the couple is not free of chances of
              separation, which may usually be the result of over-indulgence of
              the male in his profession. In love, there is a positive period
              for these males between 25 and 35 years of age.
            </p>

            <h3>Health</h3>
            <p>
              The male natives born in Krittika Nakshatra generally neglect
              their health. They have a natural tendency to not care a lot about
              their diet and tend to be lazy. These people must be careful of
              problems that can lead to issues in teeth, weak eyesight or
              accidents.

          <section className="female-section">
            <h2>Female Characteristics</h2>
            <p>
              The female born in Krittika Nakshatra reeks off a lot of emotions
              and is a bit sensitive in character. The quality is something that
              she needs to tame well, as if she doesn't, others may use the same
              against her. The emotional character of the woman here makes her
              caring and someone who anyone can trust. Besides, she is also
              quarrelsome and tends to throw her weight around both at her
              workplace and her home. Despite the odds, a blend of both
              traditional and modern makes her a desired person among all
              generations.
            </p>

            <h3>Profession</h3>
            <p>
              As far as the profession goes, if the female born in Krittika
              Nakshatra is well educated, then the most suitable professions for
              her are administrative work, especially with the government, the
              role of a teacher, doctor or even an engineer. If not educated,
              the female may end up being a housewife yet will have a natural
              thirst for doing something with her life.
            </p>

            <h3>Compatibility</h3>
            <p>
              There is always an impending chance of separation in marriage in
              the life of a female born in Kritika Nakshatra. Hence, the female
              - and her husband - will have to work harder to enjoy the bliss of
              a happy marriage. The hiccups in marriage are majorly due to the
              female's inability to understand the intentions of her relatives
              and husband's family correctly. She tends to have high
              expectations, which, if not fulfilled, may brew chances of
              separation.
            </p>

            <h3>Health</h3>
            <p>
              The female natives born in Krittika Nakshatra are stronger
              physically. But mentally, they may have to deal with stress and
              tension. The problems of tuberculosis may also hinder the progress
              of these women, hence they must not ignore any such related
              symptoms.
