              The male born in the Anuradha Nakshatra dons attractive looks
              that, however, may not be liked by everyone. Their bright eyes are
              special luring characteristics of these natives. Nature wise, the
              native is confident and a hard worker. He has a special skill of
              handling difficult situations with ease and in a systematic way.
              Yet, his mind is always wandering in the fear of what would happen
              to him in the future. The double thoughts could not only stress
              him out but also debar him from enjoying his life to the fullest
              or even forging relationships with the opposite gender. These
              people could be a bit miser too, but the quality turns out to be a
              blessing for them.

              satisfactory for you. There are also chances that you might start
              earning at a young age of 18-20 years. This will considerably
              enhance your experience, which will help you in setting up your
              own venture in the later years. The professional prospect till the
