              hardworking and aces in everything they do as they are
              multitalented. They also get along with others very well as they
              are not self-centred and love to appreciate others' hard work.
              Because of this, they easily gain a lot of popularity and
              attention even if they do not intend for it. Although it becomes
              quite difficult to understand them and build a deeper connection
              with them as they are somewhat a secretive person and rarely
              reveal their true emotions and feelings. They are very God-fearing
              people and care about how their actions affect others. So they
              rarely do anything that might hurt others following the principles
              of dharma. As they are very intuitive about their surroundings,
              they easily discover those who have ill will.
