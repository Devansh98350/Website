            <h2>Male Characteristics</h2>
            <p>
              The Male natives born in the Shravana Nakshatra have a strong
              influence of the Moon on them. And hence, these people are really
              soft-spoken in nature. The native has established values in life,
              and peer pressure can't ward him or her away from following those.

              from other males in many terms. These people are very particular
              about the tidiness and neatness of their surroundings. The trait
              helps them to think better and make better decisions for
              themselves. Unlike many other people, the male born in the
