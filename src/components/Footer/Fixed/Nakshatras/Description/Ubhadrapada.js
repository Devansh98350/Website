              higher and lower status. They will not bother others with their
              problems and are likely to look for solutions on their own. They
              have a heart of gold and will make all kinds of sacrifices for
              those who they love and trust. Although, they can have an issue
              with anger management. They are believed to lose their temper with
              the slightest provocation but will just as easily and quickly lose
              their anger and will not hold any grudge for a long period of
              time. They are believed to be very intelligent and can be an
              excellent orator. They will overcome any obstacle to reach their
              goal. Also, they are mostly very sexual people and will always
              want to have a companion of the opposite sex with them.
