            <h2>Male Characteristics</h2>
            <p>
              The male native born in Revati Nakshatra is a sincere person who
              likes to do things systematically. The natives are very practical
              and have a good understanding of how things and feelings work.
              They use their own experiences in life to guide others and thus
              are helpful. Since childhood, the native born in Revati Nakshatra
              is habitual to living an independent life. And hence he can get
              easily pissed if someone tries to control him. His trait of being
              not controlled doesn't shun for anyone, including his spouse. The
              male here also doesn't put his trust in someone easily. However,
              once he ends up trusting you, he will get way too attached to you.
              These people are also loyal and very ambitious, and even a slight
              setback can make him depressed.
            </p>

            <h3>Profession</h3>
            <p>
              The male born in Revati Nakshatra believes in the will to work and
              not the experience under his sleeves. These males likely take an
              opportunity irrespective of whether they have any experience in it
              or not and try to work on it with full vigour. This, however, may
              lead to failure and disappointment for him a majority of the time.
              Instead, if he does anything in a planned manner, nothing can stop
              him from achieving greatness in his chosen field. The native has a
              scientific bent and thus can make a future in anything related.
              However, his rewards are unlikely to be in proportion with his
              hard work as he will have to wait till the age of 50 to get the
              best out of his investments.
            </p>

            <h3>Compatibility</h3>
            <p>
              The male born in Revati Nakshatra may not have the luck to gain
              benefits from his father or members up close. He is a self-made
              person and is likely to be very dissimilar from his family members
              in ethos and attitude. This may become the reason for his
              incompatibility with his family. The same nature will, however,
              have a strong influence on her wife. His conjugal life and his
              rapport with his wife will be quite good as she will be of a
              flexible nature.
            </p>

            <h3>Health</h3>
            <p>

              pimples and acne will be ever-present for these natives. It is
              suggested that you adopt a healthy lifestyle and include yoga in
              your daily to-do task list.
