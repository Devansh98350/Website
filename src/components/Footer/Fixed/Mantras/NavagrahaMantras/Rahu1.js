          <h2>Rahu Mantra: Meaning, Significance and Benefits</h2>
          <p>
            Planet Rahu is one of the most dreaded planets in astrology, yet it
            has a significant place of its own. Though usually called out for
            delivering bad results to the native, but in its best or benefic
            form, Rahu can bring an abundance of luxuries, wealth and success to
            the native. In astrology, Rahu is called the shadow planet, which
            means it doesn't have a physical form like every other planet in
            astrology. Yet, despite being in a showdown form, the malefic
            effects of Rahu are most dreaded. However to fight these malefic
            effects of Rahu in the horoscope, Rahu mantras come in handy.
          </p>
          <p>
            As per astrologers, the strong or feeble presence of Rahu in the
            kundli of the native is the result of his or her past karma,
            especially the karma of the past birth. Means, if you had done good
            deeds in your past life, Rahu is likely to be placed in a favour of
            you. Also, a positive Rahu rewards you for your past good deeds in
            the present birth. On the other hand, bad comes to those carrying
            the load of bad karma from their previous birth.
          </p>
          <p>
            When Rahu is malefic in your horoscope and it conjuncts with other
            planets in kundli, it creates different types of bondages
            (problems). For example, Venus is considered the planet of love.
            Hence, in any case, if Venus is being influenced by a malefic Rahu,
            it can bring hiccups or problems in your love life. And sometimes,
            these hiccups can lead to situations like betrayal, breakups, etc.,
            in marriage or love. Thus it is important to always keep the harmful
            effects of Rahu in the native’s kundli to a bare minimum. According
            to the Hindu belief, Rahu can not discriminate between good and
            evil, and so it works against the standards of righteousness
            (Dharma). Hence all are equal for the planet.

          <h3>Rahu with other planets</h3>
          <p>
            Enmity, diseases and debt are the chief qualities of Rahu. Yet, on
            the positive side, those under the influence of Rahu are said to be
            confident, brave and fearless. The positive qualities of Rahu are
            one of the most desired, and having a strong Rahu in the Kundli can
            help you with these qualities. Strengthening of Rahu in kundli can
            be done by chanting the Rahu mantras on a regular basis.
          </p>
          <p>
            As Rahu has no sign of its own, the planet impacts the Lord of each
            house in the natives’ kundli. Rahu shows good results if the Lord it
            is in a relationship with is a friend to Rahu and negative results
            if the Lord of the house or planet it is in conjunction with is an
            enemy to Rahu. As per the science of Astrology, Rahu gets stronger
            in the 3rd, 6th, and 11th houses.
          </p>
          <p>
            In kundli, Rahu when comes together with Venus ends up making the
            natives greedy. This may lead him to make wrong decisions in life.
            Rahu when aligns with Jupiter forms Guru Chandal Yoga. A combination
            of Rahu and Mars prompts the native to make wrong decisions. S/he
            may end up taming bad habits such as smoking, drinking, etc.
          </p>
          <p>
            On the other hand, if Rahu is placed with an auspicious Mercury, it
            can lead to business growth for the native. However, if Rahu comes
            together with Mercury in an inauspicious position, it can be unlucky
            for the natives.
          </p>
          <p>
            Rahu is also said to bring bad results if placed in the 6th, 8th or
            12th house or if in conjunction with the lords of these houses. Rahu
            also symbolises knowledge, however, in the presence of malefic
            planets this attribute can have a reverse impact and it can make the
            native mentally weak.
          </p>
          <p>
            Likewise, there are many more combinations in Kundli that can result
            in Rahu dosh in Kundli. A malefic Rahu is never good for natives as
            it brings hindrance in career, love life and more. However, the
            harmful effects of Rahu can be tackled by reciting the Rahu mantras.
          </p>
          <h3>Important Rahu Mantras in Kundli</h3>
          <p>
            Of all the nine planets, Rahu is said to be a rogue planet. The
            planet signifies morally wrong things like lying, stealing,
            gambling, etc. But when in a benefic state, Rahu has the power to
            fulfil various material needs of the native alongside bringing him a
            lot of fame and fortune. So do we bring out the positive side Rahu?
            Well, recite these Rahu mantras.
          </p>
          <h3>1. Rahu beej Mantra</h3>
          <p>
            If the native has committed any major sin in his precious life due
            to which he is dealing with the wrath of Rahu in the present birth,
            in such cases, reciting the Rahu Beej mantra can help to ease the
            problems of the native. Also, Rahu mantra is suggested to someone
            finding it difficult to get married. So many people also dread the
            influence of black magic on them. For good, Rahu beej mantra helps

            any. Chanting Rahu Beej Mantra on a regular basis can open your

          <h3>2. Rahu Shanti Mantra</h3>
          <p>
            No one wants tension or troubles in his life. But as a rogue planet,
            Rahu, most of the time, is bound to bring troubles in the life of
            the native. In such situations, calming down the planet is
            necessary. And for the same purpose is the Rahu Shanti Mantra.
            Astrologers claim that whosoever chants the Rahu Shanti mantra mere
            two times a day can find the effect of Shani losing upon him.
          </p>
          <p>Here is the Rahu Shanti mantra:</p>

              If beginning with Rahu mantras, remember to begin chanting the
              Rahu mantra at night or after sunset. Talk to an astrologer for
              the best advice.

              The Rahu mantras are usually recited 108 times but some mantras,
              on the other hand, need to be recited less than 108 times.
