          <h2>Shani Mantra: Meaning, benefits and ways to chant</h2>
          <p>
            Shani is the God of Order and Responsibility. He tells it like it is
            and maintains honesty. Shani is the most prominent and important
            planetary body among the Navgrahas. Shani is entrusted with the task
            of dispensing fairness to individuals based on their good and
            negative karmas. Lord Shani can bring positive or terrible fortune.
            Shani moves slowly in comparison to other planets, therefore he
            spends seven and a half years in each Rashi or Zodiac sign. The
            Saade Sati era is the name given to this time frame.
          </p>
          <p>
            This is thought to be the most difficult period of a person's life.
            Professional astrologers recommend reciting Shani mantra to conquer
            Shani's afflicted position in the horoscope and the negative impacts
            of the Saade Sati period. If one worships Lord Shani Dev with
            sincerity, all troubles and difficulties can be resolved. According
            to Vedic astrology, Shani Deva is the most hazardous of all the Nav
            Grahas. He is the Sun God's son. Shani Mantra is performed to guard
            against Shani Deva's negative consequences. Today, we'll discuss the
            benefits and significance of Shani Mantra.
          </p>
          <p>
            Shani Deva terrifies the majority of Indians, especially Hindus.
            Shani Deva is known as the "Lord of Righteousness" in Hindu
            Astrology. So, if someone conducts wrong doings or "Karma," Shani
            Dev will condemn them. Shani Deva is feared by people because "He"
            brings anguish and grief into their lives. When a person is under
            the influence of Shani Dasha (also known as Sade Sati), he or she is
            destined to experience problems and misery in their lives.
          </p>
          <p>
            As a result, many people regard Shani Dev as a malefic planet who
            brings affliction, bad timing, troubles, and unhappiness into one's
            life. Shani Deva has been entrusted with the purpose and abilities
            to disperse the consequences of people's actions according to Hindu
            Astrology. As a result, Shani Deva does not spare anyone from the
            consequences of their actions.

          <h3>Shani Mantra: How do they help?</h3>
          <p>
            Chanting the Shani Mantra can help to minimise the impacts of Shani
            Deva in one's zodiac throughout the Sade Sati period, as well as
            other unwanted adverse effects of Shani Dev. The Global Law of karma
            is the fundamental principle that drives the effects of Shani Dev.
          </p>
          <p>
            So, if one does bad deeds, Shani Dev punishes him harshly, but if
            one fulfils the acts of kindness, he is blessed appropriately. As a
            result, Shani Dev acts in accordance with your karma. As a result,
            Shani Dev is appropriately known as the Lord of Fairness.
          </p>
          <p>
            Shani Dev's justice philosophy is centred on karma. As a result, one
            must be dedicated to one's commitments. Shani Dev's influence can be
            felt in the heart, psyche, and other aspects of one's life, such as
            healthcare and economical goodness.
          </p>
          <p>
            Every person is obligated to perform acts of karma. Shani Deva
            punishes you if your karma drives you to do incorrect things.
            According to Hindu Shastra, admitting one's faults in front of Shani
            Deva will alleviate the negative repercussions of bad karma.

            even eliminate the negative impacts of Shani Deva in your life.
            Chanting the Shani Mantra is a way to ask Shani Deva for endurance,
            ability, and knowledge so that you can move on in life with
            confidence, bravery, and a good outlook. You eventually begin to do
            good things, and Shani Deva rewards you accordingly.

          <h3>How to chant Shani mantra</h3>
          <p>
            To obtain Shani's blessings, people should fulfil specific criterias
            when reciting the Shani mantra.
          </p>
          <UnorderedList>
            <ListItem>
              First and foremost, it is critical that one take a shower and
              prepare one's thoughts for the Shani mantra.
            </ListItem>
            <ListItem>
              The Shani mantra should be chanted both in the morning and after
              sunset. It is best to begin reciting on a Saturday and then do it
              108 times a day. Wearing dark blue or black clothing may also
              help, as these hues are soothing to Shani Dev.
            </ListItem>
            <ListItem>
              Before repeating the Shani Mantra, choose a quiet spot and
              concentrate to generate happiness. Make a mental image of Shani
              Dev in his glorious form, and then begin the recitation with
              entire sincerity and unwavering dedication. The Shani mantra can
              also be chanted while travelling or at the office.
            </ListItem>
            <ListItem>
              Shani Dev may be satisfied if the mantra is said in front of an
              idol of Lord Hanuman. Shani Dev reveres Lord Hanuman and puts a
              great deal of faith in him.
            </ListItem>
            <ListItem>
              While repeating the Shani Mantra may be advantageous, it is not
              sufficient to seek the God of Lawyer's graces. You must also
              develop into a trustworthy, productive, and decent person.

          <h3>2. Shani Beej Mantra</h3>
          <p>
            Beej mantra, as per the Vedas, is a tool for enlarging the mind
            through sound waves. Mantra is a Hindu term made up of the elements
            "man" and "tra," which mean "thought" and "elevate," respectively.
            As a result, using a mantra can assist one in conquering the
            intellect. The fear of Shani Bhagawan motivates one to dedicate time
            to both religions and beliefs and sustain a high standard of
            alertness during this time. Individuals can go about their regular
            lives as if hardly anything has occurred, but with a keen sense of
            understanding of the strange and at times highly tough situations
            that life throws at them. The Shani Beej mantra helps overcome these
            unpredictable times in life.
          </p>
          <p>The Shani Beej mantra is :</p>
