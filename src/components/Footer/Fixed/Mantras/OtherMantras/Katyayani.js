          <h2>Katyayani Mantra: Meaning, Significance and Benefits</h2>
          <p>
            Girls of the marriageable age recite these mantras to receive the
            blessings of maa Katyayani for fast engagement. Worshiping Maa
            Katyayani removes obstacles that stand in the way of love and
            blesses the devotees with a fruitful and happy marriage. Mata
            Katyayaniis one of the nine forms of goddess Durga and is mostly
            worshiped during the nine days of Navratri. The divine goddess maa
            durga is the manifestation of shakti, the other half of lord shiva,
            and maa Katyayani is one of the many forms of Durga. Also known as
            the representative of feminine energy, maa Katyayani remains the
            fierce manifestation of female energy. Maa Katyayani is considered
            the sixth form of Durga and is accordingly worshiped on the sixth
            day of Navratri.
          </p>
          <p>
            The demon mahishasura once gained a lot of power by obtaining boons
            and wreaked havoc on the lives of everyone. When he and his henchmen
            were getting out of control and there was no one who could stop him,
            the three most powerful gods of Hindu mythology, Brahma, Vishnu and
            Shiva came together to combine their powers. With the combination of
            the strengths and might of all three gods, they created a fire from
            which goddess Katyayani came to life. She was the divine entity of
            female energy and power who had the brilliance of uncountable suns.
            Her form was that of a warrior who had three eyes and long black
            hair.
          </p>
          <p>
            She had 18 arms and in each arm, she was assigned various war
            weapons and objects that represented battle and victory. She held,
            in each of her arms many powerful weapons like a trident, discus,
            conch, dart, sword and shield, bow and arrows, thunderbolt, mace and
            battle-axe, rosary, and rose water. Mounting the lion which is her
            vahana, she charged forward with the intention to kill and destroy
            mahishasur and his henchmen. Fearing her, Mahishasur ran and hid
            inside a dead buffalo. But his efforts were all in vain as he
            couldn’t escape goddess Katyayani’s anger and was slain by her.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the Bhagavata Purana, it is written that worshiping the Mata
            Katyayani will bring fortune to those who are looking to get married
            and for a devoting husband. Mostly known as Katyayani vrata, it was
            firstly followed by the gopis(maiden) of bhir Bhoomi, the land of
            Krishna to attain Krishna as their husband. Usually followed during
            the winter months of Margashirsha, young girls follow strict rules
            like partial fasting to pray and please goddess Katyayani.

          <h3>Katyayani mantras: How do they help?</h3>
          <p>
            Reciting mantras regularly with a pure heart brings peace and
            positive energy to the performer as mantras hold extreme spiritual
            energy. By following the proper guidelines while chanting mantras, a
            kind of vibration is formed around the performer which brings
            happiness and a peaceful mindset. Katyayani mantras can be used by
            those who are facing Manglik dosha and are having difficulties in
            getting married. Manglik dosha is a phenomenon that occurs when
            someone has problems regarding the planet Mars or mangal graha.
          </p>
          <p>
            Continuous recitation of this mantra will ward off any obstacles
            that can harm the formation of a good relationship. Manglik dosha
            can also cause distortion and disrupt harmony in marital life.
            Sometimes it becomes the reason behind the early death of a spouse.
            Devotion to maa Katyayani can help in great ways to cast off the bad
            effects of mangal dosha and assure healthy and fruitful marriage.
          </p>

              To start the process of chanting the Katyayani mantra, prepare a
              red-coloured Chandan Japa mala.
            </ListItem>
            <ListItem>
              Having a picture or idol of Mata Katyayani is also helpful when
              starting the process as offering red flowers to her is very
              beneficial. But if there are no pictures available, try imagining
              the goddess in front of you.
            </ListItem>
            <ListItem>
              Wearing red-coloured clothes is also very beneficial as it pleases
              the goddess.
            </ListItem>
            <ListItem>
              With the use of the Japa mala, try chanting the mantras 125000
              times in total to get the best results. Since it is extremely hard
              to recite any mantra this many times at one go, one should break
              the number down in 12 days which will make it easier.
            </ListItem>

              Visualize that you are having the wedding of your dreams with the
              blessings of everyone close to you and a partner of your wish

              fulfill all the wishes regarding marriage and spouse.

          <h3>2. Parvati mantra for delay in marriage</h3>
          <p>
            Mangal dosha is the effect of the planet Mars (mangal graha) on the
            birth chart of a person. When a person is manglik, it is believed
            that he/she has to go through many difficulties to find a suitable
            partner. It is believed that those who have manglik dosha in their
            kundli, their marriage may get delayed because of unforeseen issues
            and couples who are struggling to get their marriage fixed might
            also have to face hurdles. To find true love becomes extremely hard
            when the kundali is affected by mangal dosha. Chanting the Parvati
            mantra will help in finding the suitable spouse for the performer.
            Parvati, a different form of shakti, is the beloved wife of lord
            shiva, and is worshiped along with lord shiva during many occasions
            involving married couples. During karwa chauth, lord shiva and
            goddess Parvati are worshiped together to get blessings for the long
            life of the husband.
