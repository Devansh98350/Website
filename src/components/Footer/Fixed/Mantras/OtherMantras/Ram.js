          <h2>Ram Mantra: Meaning, Significance and Benefits</h2>
          <p>
            Shree ram is one of the most worshiped and believed in Hindi gods
            andis looked up to as the symbol of Hinduism. The mere chanting of
            “Jay Shree Ram” is enough to mark your identity in society. Shree
            Ram was one of the incarnations of Lord Vishnu, and apart from Lord
            Krishna, one of the most important Vishnu avatars of Hindu history.
            His purpose of birth on earth was to annihilate the demons,
            specially Asurr Raj Ravana, and to set the path for humans to
            follow. He is the one that established the path of dharma and is
            considered the Maryada Purushottam, which means the perfect form of
            man that exceeds every limit.
          </p>
          <p>
            He is the ideal form of human being and his existence sets an
            example for all the men to follow to live a soulful life. Along with
            establishing the dharma among men, he is also part of the Hindu
            Trimurti in Rama-centric sects, along with being considered to be a
            supreme being rather than an avatar. He is the epitome of
            virtuousness and the embodiment of living the life of dharma. It is
            prevalent in Hinduism to live life the way Shree ram has lived and
            follow the teachings of Lord Krishna, which says no one can live
            like lord Krishna, but living life like Shree ram is the right way
            of living and is very possible. Shree Ram did not set the rules in
            the Gita and is not the author of the book, but rather lived his own
            life according to the teachings of the Gita and showed it to the
            people. Lord Shri Ram lived the life of a very simple ascetic in the
            forest. Wherever he went, he used to build a hut for three people to
            live in. While sleeping on the ground, eating tubers and roots every
            day, and used to meditate daily.
          </p>
          <p>
            On his body were clothes made by himself. With a bow and arrow, he
            used to protect everyone in the jungles from demons and predatory
            animals. One can imagine how many terrible forests used to be in
            those times and also in those forests there used to be fierce wild
            animals as well as violent wild humans. But with wisdom and
            knowledge and handling everything with patience, Shree ram was able
            to complete his trial and was successful in killing Ravana. There
            are two ways in which the Shree Ram is worshiped and viewed, the
            enchanted form is out of his own will to be born as the son of King
            Dasharath, and the second form is of a supreme Brahman, whose
            actions and spirituality delight the yogis.
          </p>
          <h2>Ram mantra: How do they help</h2>
          <p>
            One who worships Lord Ram has enhanced self-esteem and is
            self-assured. They have extremely strong willpower, their mental
            stability is strong enough to surpass any difficult situation.
            Chanting the word RAMA is enough to bring positive energy and awaken
            the soul. “Sri Ram '' is the yin(Sri) and yang(ram) of the soul, and
            brings balance to the Ida Pingala nadis of the body, which ensures
            proper blood circulation and general good health. The word “RAM” in
            itself is very powerful as it’s made of “Raa '' and “Omm” which are
            the two chakras among the seven of the human body. Worshiping Rama
            and following his ideals is the guide to achieving perfection
            spiritually. One can also expect to have material blessings as well
            by worshiping lord Ram and chanting his mantras. Along with adhering
            to the material needs of the devotees, shree ram makes way for a
            better life for the person.

          <h3>Important Shree Ram Mantras</h3>
          <h4>1. Powerful Ram Mantra</h4>
          <p>
            Lord Shri Ram is a Vachani, that is, to whomever he gives any
            promise or makes a resolution, he puts all his power to fulfill it.
            Raghukul ritual always went on, but the word did not die. Lord Shri
            Ram loved and married only one woman in his life. He never even
            thought of another woman. He loved Mother Sita immensely and could
            not live without her even for a moment. When Sita was abducted, he
            wandered from forest to forest crying in search of her, and when
            Mata Sita went to live in Valmiki’s ashram, Shri Ram also left the
            pleasures of the palaces and started sleeping on the ground.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>The Ram Mantra is:</strong>

          <p>
            <strong>Meaning-</strong> This mantra addresses the several names of
            Lord Sriram. It praises Ram as the descendant of the Raghu clan and
            the most auspicious one. It calls him the husband of Mother Sita and
            the most venerated person who can end suffering and promote
            happiness.

          <h4>2. Ram mantra to attract success and wealth</h4>
          <p>
            When Shri Ram used to go to the forests for tuber-root, there were
            many occasions when the tuber-root was not available. So he had to
            live on what was left. People often do not get the food of their
            mind when they go abroad, in the forest, in the desert, or in
            difficult areas, but meat is available everywhere. It is said that
            while living in the forest, Lakshman used to stay in fasting for
            most of the days. Living in the forest, Lord Shri Ram, Lakshmana,
            and Mother Sita never took tamasic or rajasic food. Everyone knows
            that one day and night they lived only by eating shabri berries.

            When Lord Shri Ram took exile, he renounced all his royal clothes,
            and wearing the clothes of ascetics, he left the forest with bare
            feet. They are whatever they could find in the forest, although they
            made sure never to touch nonvegetarian food, even if they had to
            sleep on an empty stomach on occasions. On many occasions, they were
            invited by multiple kings of different nations for the feast and the
            kings made ample arrangements to please them. But Shree Ram along
            with Mata Sita and brother Lakshman never accepted their invitation
            and declined with respect. They only lived in the ashrams of the
            rishi munis and sages or made their huts made of leaves, branches,
            and other raw materials.

            In difficult times, Lord Shri Ram set an example of restraint,
            determination, patience, courage, and living with fewer means
            everywhere. He also did not lose patience and restraint when making
            a treaty with another enemy, in case of a calamity. He did not take
            any decision in anger, although his brother Shree Lakshman was known
            to get angry quite easily. In the face of adversity, he used his
            intelligence to think of solutions and taught us to find a solution
