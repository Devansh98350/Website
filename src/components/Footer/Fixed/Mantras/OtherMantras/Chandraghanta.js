            Devi chandraghanta Mantra: Meaning, Significance, and Benefits
          </h2>
          <p>
            Devi Chandraghanta is one of the forms of Mata Parvati or goddess
            Durga and is widely worshiped during the third day of Navratri.
            Whoever worships Devi Durga in this form receives eternal happiness
            and success in life. They receive the strength and power to tackle
            every problem in life. She is the goddess of the Manipura chakra
            which is located at the naval and is ruled by the sun
          </p>
          <p>
            Goddess Durga is considered the feminine power, the mother of the
            universe, who is responsible for the creation, preservation, and
            destruction of all things in the universe. For ages, she has been
            seen as the true power and the supreme being and is mentioned in
            many of the Hindu scriptures such as the Yajur Veda, Vajasaneyi
            Samhita, and Taittareya Brahman. Maa Durga is the manifestation of
            Mata Parvati and has the combined power of goddess Lakshmi, goddess
            Saraswati, and goddess Kali. Maa Chandraghant is the calm and
            peaceful form of maa Durga and the mantras dedicated to her bring
            protection against internal and external negative forces.
          </p>
          <p>
            Devi Chandraghanta is believed to have established discipline and
            justice in the world. Her vahana is a lion, which represents the
            ‘dharma’ and has a body the color of gold. Among the eight of her
            ten hands, she holds the weapons that represent different things,
            and the rest of the two hands are for granting blessings and boons
            to the devotees and preventing any harm. She also possesses the
            all-seeing third eye at the center of the forehead. Devi
            Chandraghanta is the representation of supreme happiness and
            satisfaction. She showers knowledge, peace, and serenity among her
            devotees and gives them the feeling of fulfillment like a gentle
            breeze on a moonlit night. Devi Chandraghanta removes the sorrow
            from within and brings out the confident person who can fight any
            battle.
          </p>

          <h2>1. Chandraghanta mantra</h2>

          <p>
            Devi Chandraghanta is the married form of Devi Parvati. She started
            to adorn her forehead with a bindi in the shape of a half-moon after
            she got married to Lord Shiva. From then on, the goddess Parvati was
            given the name Devi Chandraghanta. This particular form of goddess
            Parvati is inclined more toward the welfare of her devotees, having
            a more subdued, calm, and peaceful nature. But she is always ready
            for war, fighting the evils of the world with her ten hands holding
            various weapons representing something specific. It is believed that
            the shape of the moon-bell on her forehead expels all kinds of
            spirits from the life of her devotees.

          <h2>2. Chandraghanta Dhyana mantra</h2>
          <p>
            It is believed that Devi Parvati had to go through a lot of
            struggles to convince Lord Shiva to marry her. But Lord Shiva had
            sworn on maintaining celibacy and to never get married after the
            death of Devi Sati, his first consort. Devi Parvati tried her best
            to convince the Lord that she was an incarnation of Devi Sati, and
            after a long period of struggles and penance, Lord Shiva finally
            agreed to marry her. When he along with other few gods arrived at
            the palace of King Himavat, father of Goddess Parvati and the ruler
            of Himalayas, Lord Shiva displayed his extremely fierce form, which
            scared Goddess Parvati’s mother Menavati and she fainted. Then, Devi
            Parvati took the form of Devi Chandraghanta which startled all the
            gods present including Lord Shiva. She prayed to Lord Shiva to
            return to his calm and charming form. Lord Shiva heeded her
            requirements and turned into his charming and pleasant form. This
            pleased Mata Menavati and the wedding took place.
