          <h2>Lakshmi Mantra: Meaning, Significance and Benefits</h2>
          <p>
            Meditating with mantras is one of the most powerful ways to quiet
            the fluctuations of the mind. A mantra is a tool for the mind, and
            it allows our awareness to more easily turn inward. Mantras are
            dedicated to the divine, to the supreme ones above humanity who
            protect the humans from harm and evil. Mantras are a way to connect
            to the higher universe, every sound and vibration of the mantra
            connects the being to the larger Brahman. They offer inner peace,
            stable mental functions and prosperity to the chanter and hold great
            value in Vedic cultures.
          </p>
          <p>
            Lakshmi is the divine consort of Lord Vishnu the preserver of the
            universe. But that is not all she is. In Vaishnavism she as the
            consort of Vishnu is the divine force that helps him maintain the
            universe. In Sri Vaishnavism her worship is essential to attain the
            Lord Vishnu. She is worshipped and revered in many forms. She is the
            goddess of wealth, fortune, power, beauty, fertility and prosperity,
            and is associated with Maya. She is Shakti, the divine raw power
            that energises the universe and keeps it well. She brings
            prosperity, wealth and beauty to her worshippers. Lakshmi along with
            Parvati and Saraswati make the tri-devi or the three principal
            goddesses.
          </p>
          <p>
            She is known by many names and is worshipped in many forms. She is
            called Padma because she appeared from the ocean with a lotus in her
            hand and because she sits on a lotus throne. She is called Sri
            (Noble) because of her elegance and high status. Lakshmi is
            popularly called Chanchala (mischievous or whimsical) because she
            does not stay in one place and changes her adobes quickly. She is
            also called Vishnupriya (beloved of Vishnu) and as Vaishnavi.
          </p>
          <p>
            She is also worshipped in various epithets. As Mahalaxmi, she is in
            her greatest form. She is as grand as ever and all power in this
            form. According to Garuda Purana, Lakshmi is considered as Prakriti
            (Mahalakshmi) and is identified with three forms — Sri, Bhu and
            Durga. The three forms consist of Satva ('goodness'), rajas, and
            tamas ('darkness') gunas, and assists Vishnu (Purusha) in creation.
            Without her creation and sustenance would be impossible. She is
            popularly worshipped as Ashtalakshmi (eight Lakshmis) each of which
            represents one source of wealth. Another popular version of her is
            the Varalakshmi (Lakshmi of Spouses) who is popular during weddings
            ceremonies.
          </p>
          <h2>The Story of Lakshmi</h2>
          <p>
            According to the Vishnu Purana, the universe was created when the
            devas and asuras churned the cosmic Kshirasagar. Lakshmi came out of
            the ocean bearing lotus, along with divine cow Kamadhenu, Varuni,
            Parijat tree, Apsaras, Chandra (the moon), and Dhanvantari with
            Amrita ('nectar of immortality'). When she appeared, she had a
            choice to go to Devas or Asuras. She chose Devas' side and among
            thirty deities, she chose to be with Vishnu. Thereafter, in all
            three worlds, the lotus-bearing goddess was celebrated.In the Garuda
            Purana, Linga Purana and Padma Purana, Lakshmi is said to have been
            born as the daughter of the divine sage Bhrigu and his wife Khyati
            and was named Bhargavi.
          </p>
          <p>
            In Book 9 of Satapatha Brahmana, Sri emerges from Prajapati, after
            his intense meditation on the creation of life and nature of the
            universe. She is described as a resplendent and trembling woman at
            her birth with immense energy and powers. The gods are all taken
            aback, desire her, and immediately become envious of her and her
            powers. The gods approach Prajapati and request permission to kill
            her and then take her powers, talents, and gifts. Prajapati refuses,
            tells the gods that men should not kill women and that they can seek
            her gifts without violence.
          </p>
          <p>
            The gods then approach Lakshmi. Agni gets food, Soma gets kingly
            authority, Varuna gets imperial authority, Mitra acquires martial
            energy, Indra gets force, Brihaspati gets priestly authority,
            Savitri acquires dominion, Pushan gets splendour, Saraswati takes
            nourishment and Tvashtri gets forms. The hymns of Shatapatha
            Brahmana thus describe Sri as a goddess born with and personifying a
            diverse range of talents and powers. Meaning it is through her that
            they receive their powers and truly no one is kept from her
            generosity.
