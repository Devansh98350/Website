          <h2>Navagraha Mantra: Meaning, Significance and Benefits</h2>
          <p>
            The nine planets in motion, known as Navgrahas, are said to regulate
            the situations in life according to Vedic Astrology. The position
            and power of these planets in an astrology chart has a variety of
            effects on humans, both positive and harmful.
          </p>
          <p>
            Navagraha is a Sanskrit term that signifies "Nav" meaning "nine" and
            "Graha" meaning "to take or hold."
          </p>
          <p>
            The nine elements in our Cosmic System are known as grahas in Vedic
            astrology because they are developmental forces that educate humans
            how to live in harmony with the cosmos. As a result, Navagraha or
            Navgrah refers to the nine planets. Planetary positions and motions
            have an impact on our lives, affecting our psychological, spiritual,
            economic, and physical well-being.
          </p>
          <p>
            Each of these nine planets is controlled by a Hindu god and
            represents a different aspect of a person's existence. If the planet
            in a kundali is favourable or dignified, the native will have a nice
            time throughout its Mahadasha (major phase) and transit. A malefic
            or weakened planet, on the contrary, is bound to cause problems in a
            person's life.
          </p>
          <h2>Navagraha Mantras: How do they help?</h2>
          <p>
            Navagraha mantras are beneficial mantras that work as strong
            therapeutic aids, balancing out the planets' negative influences in
            our life. These are extremely important in establishing a person's
            physical and mental health. Navagraha is a Sanskrit term that
            signifies "Nav" meaning "nine" and "Graha" meaning "to take or
            hold."
          </p>
          <p>
            Vedic traditions have given Navagraha Mantras for appeasing the
            negative planets in an astrology chart to help us sail through
            difficult times. These Navagraha Mantras are essentially beej (seed)
            mantras that resonate at the similar level as the planets. These
            mantras are holy Sanskrit chants that, when chanted, can counteract
            the planets' negative energies while amplifying the favourable ones.
          </p>
          <p>
            The planets will have a favourable impact on all elements of your
            life if you recite these mantras on a daily basis. Any health
            problems, financial difficulties, or disagreements are the outcome
            of their unfavourable moves. One will have more mental peace and
            spiritual tranquillity as a result of them.
          </p>
          <h2>How to chant the Navagraha mantras</h2>
          <p>
            The Navagraha mantras have an integrative strength that creates
            world peace. The nine planets' motions have an impact on your daily
            life. People experience poor luck, loss, disease, and a variety of
            other sad events from time to time.
          </p>
          <p>
            Before you begin repeating these mantras, there are a few things to
            consider.
          </p>
          <UnorderedList>
            <ListItem>
              Since these mantras are sacred, they must be chanted with a pure
              body and mind. Take a shower and dress in colours that reflect the
              planet before beginning the chant. You'll also need a mat that
              matches the planet's hue. White for the sun, blue for saturn and
              so on. There is a strict code of conduct and hygiene that one must
              follow.
            </ListItem>
            <ListItem>
              For the planet, you must utilise precise guidelines and timeframe.
              Within 40 days, try to finish the chant. All through the duration,
              you should say the designated mantra in the exact area and at the
              appropriate moment.
            </ListItem>
            <ListItem>
              During the passage of the planets, it is essential to chant the
              appropriate planet's mantra. Only chant these mantras if these
              planets are having a detrimental impact on your life. On the day
              that the planet indicates, begin singing the mantras.
            </ListItem>
            <ListItem>
              One should use a specific rosary bead for every planet. Rudraksha
              Chaplet or specific gemstones for each planet, such as a coral for
              Mars, or Ruby for the Sun, can be used.
            </ListItem>
            <ListItem>
              If these mantras are not recited correctly, they will have little
              impact or would not operate at all. The complete significance of
              the mantra might be ruined by a single mispronunciation. Even the
              pace should be consistent, and there should be no mistakes in the
              syllable flow.

          <h3>Important Navagraha Mantras</h3>
          <h4>1. Sun or Surya mantra</h4>
          <p>
            The Sun, or Surya, is known as the Illumination of Knowledge. In
            addition, he is the destroyer of misinformation. In this Planetary
            System, the sun is the foundation of vitality. All of the planets
            are kept in their orbits by its force of gravity. Surya represents
            self-assurance, knowledge, strength, and a feeling of self-identity.
            He is the ruler of the heavenly bodies realm. He mounts a chariot
            drawn by seven horses, each representing one of the seven days of
            the week, the rainbow's seven hues, or the seven states of
            awareness. A ring with a dot in the middle is the Sun's emblem. The
            dot represents the origin of creation, while the circle represents
            its realised presence.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>The Surya mantra is:</strong>
          </p>
          <p className="red">|| ऊँ ह्रां ह्रीं ह्रौं सः सूर्याय नमः।|</p>
          <p>Aum Hran Hreen Hron Seh Suryay Namah</p>
          <p>
            <strong>Meaning-</strong>I praise the Great Sun God for his divine
            blessings.

          <h4>2. Moon or Chandra mantra</h4>
          <p>
            Chandra or Soma is the name given to the Moon, which is also known
            as the Illumination of Dedication. Chandra is thought to nourish
            life with its calming cool beams. As it radiates the Sun's light, it
            also serves as a reminder to the Earth of the phases of the moon,
            which are linked to the soul and health. The intellect completely
            emits light of the spirit at the full moon, or Purnima. The body
            stops the beam and prevents it from reaching the consciousness on
            Amavasya, or new moon. The Moon's position also reveals our
            relationship with our moms. The phases of the moon have an impact on
            creativity.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>The Chandra mantra is:</strong>

          <h4>3. Mars or Mangal mantra</h4>
          <p>
            Mangal, also known as Mars, is the bringer of good fortune.
            Dedication and perseverance are two of its traits. It is the
            astronomical bodies' administrative authority after the Sun. He is
            like a god's army commander, leading him on solo expeditions and
            voyages and defending everyone from invaders. It depicts space
            exploration and military action in a societal sense, and it reflects
            blood flow, immune response, and other human functions in a personal
            context. Mars represents power, boldness, and the willingness to
            battle. He also has control over the native's competitive powers. He
            is in charge of our bodies' functioning. A person with an elevated
            Mars can be blessed with great welfare and wellness. A weak or
            weakened Mars, on the other hand, can make a person fearful.
          </p>

          <h4>5. Jupiter or Brihaspati Mantra</h4>
          <p>
            Jupiter, also known as Brihaspati, is the "God of Gods." It is also
            known as the "Spirit of the Vast" because of its enormous size.
            Spirituality, education, ethical code, and harmony among mortals and
            immortals are all things he promotes. He serves as the Gods'
            counsellor and bestows prosperity on them. It has an impact on
            motivation, enthusiasm, and optimism. Jupiter is also the most
            beneficent and compassionate planet in the solar system. He enhances
            the house's features wherever it is located. Among the Navgrahas, he
            is the instructor who bestows knowledge on the people. It denotes
            good fortune, money, and knowledge. It is also thought that if this
            graha is weak in a kundali, the person will never be able to acquire
            all-encompassing wisdom.
