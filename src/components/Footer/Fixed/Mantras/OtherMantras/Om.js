          <h2>Om Mantra: Meaning, Significance and Benefits</h2>
          <p>
            OM is not just a sound but the wave of the Universe. Om is said to
            be the first sound to be produced in the Universe, and thus chanting
            OM is supposed to bring many benefits to the native. The sound OM
            doesn’t have a meaning attached to it. What we mean is that just
            like every other word, say a flower or mountain, etc. has a meaning,
            one can’t associate a certain definition to the word OM. The meaning
            of “OM” (ॐ) is different for each and every one of us. Chanting the
            Om mantra in astrology is a sacred practice that helps the body and
            mind to feel energised and positive. The sound of Om is not only
            considered sacred in Hinduism but also holds a prominent place in
            other religions such as Jainism, Buddhism and Sikhism. As per these
            religions, the OM mantra connects all the individuals on the planet
            with the Universe or the supreme power that guides it.
          </p>
          <h3>Om Mantra Origin</h3>
          <p>
            The sound of OM is associated with the Big Bang. As per astrologers,
            OM had stemmed from the time when the Universe was coming into
            reality. Astrologers quote OM as the sound of the creator, which is
            made of three syllables 'A,' 'U' and 'M'. The sound is special
            because, unlike other sounds that are produced after two objects
            strike together, OM, on the other hand, can produce vibration on its
            own. It is believed that when a person chants the OM mantra deeply,
            the vibration emanating from his or her body gets tuned with the
            soul, and unifies with the One who is beyond this Universe.
          </p>
          <h3>OM (ॐ) - Essence of ‘A’ ‘U’ ‘M’ Vibrations</h3>
          <p>
            In the Vedic texts and sculptors, OM is considered both as a sound
            and a symbol, with powers of its own. It is said to bring wisdom to
            the native, and when pronounced correctly, it leads to the spreading
            of hum throughout the body and soul of the native in the form of
            ‘AUM’ which are the elements of Om mantra in astrology.
          </p>
          <p>
            A U M as per astrology represents the 3 basic fundamentals of life
            that are Creation, Preservation and Destruction. When one chants the
            Om mantra, each of these syllables brings out something or the other
            in the native.
          </p>
          <UnorderedList>
            <ListItem>
              ‘A’ corresponds to waking up in the conscious state of mind called

            The recitation of the Om Mantra with utmost devotion and pure heart
            can take the native on a spiritual voyage. The recitation of the OM
            mantra doesn’t only come with numerous physical benefits but also
            aids a native’s mental capability to relieve himself of stress and
            worries by aligning his consciousness with the universe. This is the
            only reason why OM forms the foundation of numerous mantras in
            astrology.

          <p>
            As we said, the OM mantra is the essence of all other mantras, Vedas
            and rituals in astrology. In fact, if you go to look for it, you
            will find that mostly all the mantras begin with Om. Om mantra,
            sometimes also known as the Lord Shiv Mantra, is chanted across
            ceremonies such as marriage, mundan, while worshipping the deities,
            and more. The Om Mantra is also recited while meditating to align
            your thoughts with the heavenly energies.

            the sense of enlightenment in the native. The Aum mantra can be
            recited by anyone in order to rejuvenate or recharge. The mantra can
            be recited by anyone to understand the deeper meaning of life and
            attain peace and unburden oneself.
          </p>
          <h3>How to chant the OM mantra</h3>
          <p>
            Astrologers say that OM is also known as Pranava or Omkara in Vedic
            texts. Here, the word Pranava means the Sustainer of life, and
            Omkara stands for the beginning. Om as a word or mantra has a wide
            expectation as it is acknowledged by many religions such as
            Hinduism, Jainism and Buddhism. It is also adopted as a significant
            part of Meditation or Yoga.
