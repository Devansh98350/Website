          <h2>Kali Mantra: Meaning, Significance, and Benefits</h2>
          <p>
            Goddess Kali is the divine protector of the earth who is also known
            as Kalika in Hinduism. But due to the goddess' destructive power,
            Kali is also known as the Dark Mother. As per mythology, the word
            Kali comes from the Sanskrit word Kala, which means time. Goddess
            Kali, therefore, represents time, change, power, creation,
            preservation and destruction. The word Kali also means “the black
            one”, the feminine noun of the Sanskrit adjective Kala. As per
            spiritual texts, Goddess Kali is considered a fierce form of
            Durga/Parvati and the consort of Lord Shiva. Besides being a
            destructor of bad powers of the universe, Kali ma is also a great
            giver to those who do good deeds and worship her with utmost
            devotion. Hence pleasing Kali ma allows the native a lot of
            compassion and blessings.
          </p>
          <p>
            As per mythology, Kali maa is the first of the 10 Mahavidyas or
            manifestations of the Great Goddess. She is usually portrayed in a
            form where she dances or stands on her consort God Shiva, who lies
            calm and prostrated beneath her. Kali Maa is worshipped throughout
            the country but majorly in the seas of Bengal, Assam, Kashmir,
            Punjab, Himachal Pradesh, Kerala and Tamil Nadu, along with Nepal
            and Sri Lanka.
          </p>
          <p>
            Over the centuries, the Goddess Kali has taken many forms to protect
            the Dharma and religion and destroy the one who commits sins.
            Astrologers say that Maa Kalika is the most awakened goddess in
            Hinduism and has walked the earth in four forms – Dakshina Kali,
            Shamshan Kali, Mother Kali and Mahakali. All these forms have served
            different purposes, right from Raksha Slaughter to the healing of
            the earth and its natives.
          </p>
          <h3>Story behind the destructive form of Maa Kali</h3>
          <p>
            There was a notorious asura named Daruk who had pleased Brahma and
            thus was rewarded a boon. The boon allowed the asura to cause grief
            to the Gods and Brahmins. If this wasn't enough, Daruk also started
            setting his kingdom in heaven. Seeing this, all the Gods reached out
            to Brahma and Vishnu, where they were told only a lady can kill the
            evil Daruk.
          </p>
          <p>
            Hearing this, all the Devtas donned a female form and went to fight
            Daaruk, only to get defeated by him. Post the failure, the Gods
            reached the Kailash mountain to share the ordeal with Lord Shiva.
            After listening to the Gods, Lord Shiva looked at Maa Parvati and
            said, "hey Kalyani I pray to destroy the evil Daruk and save the
            world." Listening to this, a part of Mother Parvati entered Lord
            Shiva.
          </p>
          <p>
            That part of Bhagwati Mata entered the body of Lord Shiva and due to
            the poison in the throat of Shiva, Bhagwati Mata turned into a black
            Goddess. Lord Shiva felt that part inside of him and opened his
            third eye and appeared as Goddess Kali in a fierce form.
          </p>
          <p>
            Just like Shiva, Maa Kali had a third eye and a lunar line. The
            throat had a sign of Karla poison, and she carries a trident. Seeing
            the fierce form of Mother Kali, Gods and Siddhas started fleeing.
            With the mere hum of Maa Kali, all the Asura army including Daruk
            was burnt to ashes. Yet, the fierceness of Kali wasn't over. The
            mother’s anger began to burn the whole world. To save the world from
            the wrath, Shiva took the form of a child and appeared in front of
            Kali.
          </p>
          <p>
            When mother Kali saw that child Shirupi, she became fascinated by
            that form. She embraced Shiva and started feeding him with her
            breasts. Soon, Maa Kali became unconscious due to Shivji drinking
            the wrath of mother Kali. In order to bring the Goddess into
            consciousness, Shivji performed Shiva Tandava. When mother Kali came
            back to her senses, she saw Shiva dancing and joined him, due to
            which she was also called Yogini.
          </p>
          <h3>The two forms of Goddess Kali</h3>
          <p>
            In Hinduism, Goddess Kali is mainly portrayed and worshipped in two
            forms. The first is the four-armed form, and the second is the
            10-armed form, which is also known as Mahakali. Both these forms
            have different meanings attached to them.
          </p>
          <h3>Four-armed form</h3>
          <p>
            The Indian art portrays the four-armed Kali in black or blue colour.
            The eyes of Kali are red in colour which depicts rage. Her hair is
            shown dishevelled, small fangs sometimes protrude out of her mouth
            and her tongue is lolling. The Goddess wears a skirt made of human
            arms and a garland which is made of human heads. The four-arm form
            of kali stands on the calm and prostate Shiva. All her four hands
            hold a different thing, mainly a sword, a Trishul (trident), a
            severed head, and a bowl or skull-cup (kapala) catching the blood of
            the severed head.
          </p>
          <p>
            In her left hands, Kali holds a sword and a human head. Here, the
            sword signifies divine knowledge, meanwhile the human head signifies
            the human ego, which must be slain by divine knowledge in order to
            attain moksha.
          </p>
          <p>
            The right hands of Maa Kali holds the Abhaya (fearlessness) and
            Varada (blessing) mudras, which means her devotees will always be
            saved as she will guide them during and after life.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Goddess also dons a garland consisting of human heads, variously
            enumerated at 108 or 51, which is why she is known as the mother of
            all the mantras in astrology.
          </p>
          <h3>The ten-armed form</h3>
          <p>
            The ten-armed form of Kali is her Maha Kali form. In her Maha Kali
            form, she is depicted as shining like a blue stone. Maha Kali has as
            many as ten faces, ten feet and three eyes for each head. All her
            ten hands carry various components, each of which represents the
            power of one of the Devas or Hindu Gods. This power is depicted in
            the form of the weapons that Maha Kali carries. The implication is
            that Mahakali is responsible for the powers that these deities
            possess and the implication is in line with the interpretation that
            Mahakali is identical to Brahman.
          </p>
          <p>
            At times, people also tend to worship the “ek mukhi” or one-headed
            idol of Maha Kali displayed with ten arms, signifying the same
            concept.
          </p>
          <p>
            The power tools of Kali are the Kundalini Shakti (the power of
            spiritual electricity); the Kriya Shakti, the power to creatively
            affect the universe; and Iccha Shakti, the power of will that
            personally compels our physical movements and actions, while in the
            universe it causes the galaxies to rush away from one another into
            the cosmic night. The chanting of various mantras helps the native
            have these energies for themselves.
          </p>
          <h3>How to chant the Kali mantras</h3>
          <p>
            Goddess Kali represents the colour black, and hence darkness appeals
            to her. This is how you should chant the Kaali Mantras.
          </p>
          <UnorderedList>
            <ListItem>
              Although Kaali Mantra can be chanted in the morning, hours after
              sunset are more feasible to recite these mantras.
            </ListItem>
            <ListItem>
              It is best that you chant the Kaali Mantra on a new moon day
              (Amavasya). Wear the colour Red during the Maa Kali mantra
              recitation or Puja as Red is the colour that appeases the Goddess.
            </ListItem>
            <ListItem>
              Also, if you plan to keep an idol or picture of Goddess Kali while
              reciting the mantra, you must make sure to keep it on a red cloth.
            </ListItem>
            <ListItem>
              When reciting the Mantras, offer red flowers, fruits and sweets to
              Maa Kali. Always sit facing the East or North direction when
              reciting the Kali mantras.
            </ListItem>
            <ListItem>
              As soon as you begin the recital, you will feel a certain
              vibration filling your being with strength and confidence.
            </ListItem>
            <ListItem>
              Any Kali mantra you pick up, it is advised that you chant the
              Kaali mantra for 40 days to gain all its benefits.
            </ListItem>
            <ListItem>
              For better benefits, don't eat non-vegetarian food or avoid eating
              onion and garlic as well.
