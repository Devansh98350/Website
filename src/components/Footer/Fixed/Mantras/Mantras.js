          <h3>Vedic Mantras in astrology</h3>
          <p>
            Mantras have a well-entrenched significance in astrology, especially
            mantras for 9 planets in astrology orNavagraha mantras as they call
            them. Each planet in astrology maintains its own significance in a
            native’s life as it’s the positives or negatives of these planets
            that influence his or her life decisions in the long term. Hence, as
            any astrologer would tell you, to get the best results from life,
            pleasing different planets in astrology becomes crucial. In fact,
            not just pleasing the planets, but when the question is about
            getting the best from life, pleasing any astronomical body,
            including Nakshatras, Vastu energy, Yantras or even God can help.
            And one of the many ways to please these elements of astrology is
            through mantras.
          </p>
          <h3>What is Vedic Mantra in Astrology?</h3>
          <p>
            Before we sit down to learn about all the different types of mantras
            in astrology , it is crucial that we first understand what mantras
            are all about and how to use or say, recite them, and what benefits
            can different mantras bring to the native.
          </p>
          <p>
            The ancient Vedic astrology, for 1000s of years, has been about
            making life easy for an individual. And to do so, Vedic astrology
            recognises three major remedies or upays. These three remedies are{" "}
            Mantras, Yantras and Gemstones.
          </p>
          <p>
            When we talk about Mantra recitation as a remedy, it is considered
            the most sought way not only to decipher and solve your problems but
            also to please God and planets in astrology. In fact, reciting
            Mantras is also associated with personal satisfaction and can allow
            anyone peace of mind if they have been struggling to find some.
            Hence, mantras in astrology are not just about spiritual benefits
            but also psychological benefits.
          </p>
          <p>
            To define, Mantras in Vedic astrology are a combination of syllabus
            or hymns, which, if pronounced correctly, helps the native to
            concentrate one’s mind on the universal energy and infinite
            spiritual energy within the self. Mantras have existed in the world
            for over 1000s of years and find mention in numerous religious books
            written in the past, including the Vedas. Over the years, as Rishis
            have come to realise the benefits of reciting Mantras in astrology,
            they have happened to add-on to the list of mantras.
          </p>
          <p>
            The essence of the Mantra comes from its ‘Root word’ or Beej and the
            power generated by it is called Mantra Shakti. Each of the root
            words in a mantra is associated with a planet or God. Mantra
            Chanting or Mantra jaap physically prompts you to synchronise your
            sound, breathing and senses. The sound produced by the mantras has
            the ability to transform your emotions and the way you think
            altogether and take you to a higher spiritual level. In fact,
            recitation of mantras on a regular basis creates a sense of
            spiritual awareness in the person and leads him towards a life of
            peace and tranquillity.
          </p>
          <p>
            Today, with the emergence of Yoga and its worldwide acceptability as
            a way of mental and physical healing has given a major recognition
            to mantra chanting. Even science today believes in the power of
            mantra and recommends people to combine it with their Yoga schedule
            to experience peace and well being of mind, body and soul.
          </p>
          <h3>Relationship between Mind and Mantras</h3>
          <p>
            Mantras can bring you many benefits, but if you think reciting
            mantras would do some magic and take away all your problems at once,
            then you are simply living in a bubble. If you ever ask an
            astrologer how Mantras work, they will tell you how a mantra alters
            the way you think, which eventually permits you to change your life
            or actions for good. However, to have these wonderful benefits of
            mantras on your mind, you need to practise - recite - them on a
            regular basis.
          </p>
          <p>
            The word ‘mantra’ has its roots in the ancient Sanskrit language.
            Mantra as a word is made of two terms ‘man’ which means ‘mind’ and
            ‘tra’ which means ‘tool or instrument’. Thus a Manta is nothing but
            a tool for thinking. As only when you think of your full potential,
            only then can you make the required changes in your life. But the
            question must be asked, why do we end up plaguing our thinking
            process? Astrologers claim that humans are not just intellectual
            beings but also emotional beings who are habitual to making
            decisions based on their emotional acumen. This leads to unalignment
            of mind and feelings at times, which results in confusion for the
            native. Hence to align our minds with our feelings, mantras come
            into the picture.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our mind is always in a state of activity, and recitation of a
            mantra acts as an instrument to bring it to a standstill for
            relaxation. As we are in our peace zone now, we are able to connect
            with our subconscious. This allows us a deeper state of awareness,
            thus helping us make better decisions in life. In fact, some of the
            mantras in astrology are simply melodic phrases that do not even
            have any particular meaning. Their sole purpose is to musically
            uplift the senses of an individual, as music is usually known to hit
            the right chords within us. This way, one is better able to align
            his mind and heart to take a fruitful life decision for himself.
          </p>
          <h3>Astrological importance of Mantras</h3>
          <p>
            As someone born in India, it is likely impossible that you haven't
            heard a Mantra in your life. Be it a temple, a wedding ceremony or
            simply Bhoomi Pujan, Pandits tend to recite mantras at all these,
            and many more occasions. The mantras are recited to appease either
            the planets or Gods, and is one of the ways to ask them for their
            blessings. Having said that, there are numerous mantras in
            astrology, and each one of them is associated with a divine force.
          </p>
          <p>
            Just like there is a mantra for all planets in astrology, similarly,
            there are mantras for each Chakra in astrology too. So in case any
            of the Chakra in your body gets blocked or is not able to transfer
            the required energy, chanting the associated mantra with it can help
            unblock it and can surge its life force energy.
          </p>
          <p>
            Besides, Mantra chanting is an essential part of many religions.
            Reciting a mantra helps the native connect with the divinity in the
            universe who he thinks of as the ruling force. You must have seen in
            movies or even heard from your elders (or even in Yoga) how in order
            to connect with the supreme force we first need to focus our
            thoughts on one thing. Reciting mantras helps in doing just that. It
            calms our minds and helps us attain the state where we can feel our
            inner consciousness. Although doing so is tough, but we do have a
            plan for it. And what's that?
          </p>
          <h3>The 40 days concept of Mantra</h3>
          <p>
            Just like it takes 21 days to tame any habit, similarly, it takes
            approx 40 days to shift your consciousness towards spirituality and
            mental peace. If practising mantra reciting, astrologers suggest
            that you must recite a mantra 108 times a day for a cycle of 40
            days. 40 days is the minimum time required to make a shift in the
            consciousness of a person and let him brew the focus it requires to
            get the best out of reciting a mantra. Also, the number 108 refers
            to the number of nadis that need to get energised in order to feel
            the blissful aspects of a mantra.
          </p>
          <h3>History of Vedic Mantras Recitation</h3>
          <p>
            Most of the Mantras are written in Sanskrit because of the fact that
            Sanskrit words produce pure vibrations. Writing Mantras in Sanskrit
            helps produce pure vibrations of the chakras thus ensuring they
            don’t get blocked. Writing mantras is an age-old practice as these
            mantras can be found in texts dating back to 1000 BC. At its
            simplest, the word ‘OM’ is a mantra and is believed to be the first
            sound that originated on the earth. In more sophisticated forms,
            mantras are melodic phrases with spiritual interpretations such as a
            human longing for truth, reality, light, immortality, peace, love,
            knowledge, and action.
          </p>
          <p>
            Today, the structure and type of mantra vary as per the religion -
            Hinduism, Jainism, Buddhism or Sikhism. But most of these mantras
            are said to have originated from the vedic school of thoughts. The
            Rigveda Samhita contains about 10552 Mantras, classified into ten
            books called Mandalas. A Mantra can take distinct form including ṛc
            (verses from the Rigveda) and sāman (musical chants from the
            Sāmaveda).
          </p>
          <p>
            Since the Vedic period, the hymns and verses have been narrated and
            recited by the Rishis. The rishis, however, are not the producer of
            these mantras and are only responsible for sharing their knowledge
            of mantras revealed to them. It's the Vedic poets who we need to
            give the credit for coming up with mantras. The Vedic poets were
            fascinated by the inspirational power of poems and referred to them
            as root dhi-, which evolved into dhyana (meditation) of Hinduism.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the mid-Vedic period, mantras were derived from all Vedic
            compositions. They included ṛc (verses from Rigveda), sāman (musical
            chants from the Sāmaveda), yajus (a muttered formula from the
            yajurveda), and nigada (a loudly spoken yajus).
          </p>
          <p>
            Thereafter, during the Hindu epics period, there were add-ons to
            vedas as they multiplied to meet numerous needs of people. In fact,
            various schools of Mantras emerged, including Tantric schools. In
            the Linga Purana, Mantra is listed as one of the 1,008 names of Lord
            Shiva.
          </p>
          <h3>Types of Mantras in astrology</h3>
          <p>
            Over the centuries, Mantras have diversified and surely there have
            been add-ons to the list. In fact, Mantras have been categorised as
            per the needs and requirements of the people. Hence, with
            categorization has emerged different types of Mantras. These mantras
            are associated with planets in astrology, Gods, nakshatra, and
            various other aspects such as love, marriage, heath etc. All in all,
            there are as many as 70 million mantras in astrology today. And
            whether they will work for you or not depends upon the temperament
            of the person narrating it and not the superiority of the mantra
            over one another.
          </p>
          <p>
            When considering the types of mantras, there are three - Beej
            Mantra, Saguna mantra and Nirguna Mantra.
          </p>
          <h3>1. Beej Mantra</h3>
          <p>
            One of the most sacred mantras is 'OM'. It is a beej mantra, meaning
            a seed sound that forms the basis of all the mantras. Om is a
            universal beej mantra as it has found a place in various religions.
            There are many more beej mantras that form the basis of all other
            mantras in astrology. Each of these beej mantras is associated with
            some deity. When chanted with focus and devotion, beej mantras help
            in fulfilling the desire of any native.

            Saguna is a Sanskrit word meaning “with attributes” or “having
            qualities." Saguna mantras are sometimes called deity mantras

            Last but not least are the Nirguna mantras, which are said to have
            originated from the Vedic texts and are thus the oldest mantras. No
            deities are invoked with these words. The Nirguna mantras can be
            very difficult to interpret and are considered to not have a
            specific form or meaning. These mantras are said to have their
            identification with all of creation and contain the fundamental
            truths in yogic philosophy. It is said that one’s mind must be very
            strong to be able to concentrate on the abstract Nirguna mantras.
            <h4>Benefits of reciting Mantras</h4>
            From invoking deities to chanting them during numerous rituals,
            mantras in astrology have various benefits. Here are some benefits

          <h3>Mantras for planets in astrology</h3>
          <p>
            Navgrahas are nine planets that rule the horoscope of each and every
            person on earth as per astrology. It is the influence of these
            planets that help in deciding the fate of any native. The influence
            of the planet can either be positive or negative based upon how or
            with whom the planet is placed in your Kundli. For instance, a
            planet may be placed in a negative house or simply with a negative
            sign in the Kundli, and thus can bring bad results for you. In such
            situations, using a mantra as the force to counter the bad effects
            of a planet in your life can help. Hence, there are mantras for all
            nine planets in astrology.{" "}
