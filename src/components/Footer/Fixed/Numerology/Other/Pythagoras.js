          <h2>Pythagorean Numerology: An insight into Western astrology</h2>
          <p>
            Pythagorean numerology is also known as Modern numerology and starts
            with six primary numbers. Three of these numbers are derived from
            the native’s birth date, and the other three come from the name. And
            these six numbers ideally give a clear insight into who they are and
            how they can improvise their lives. It basically decodes everything
            that lies behind the birth, date, and name of the person.
          </p>
          <p>
            Right from a major impact to a minor one, Pythagorean numerology
            helps the person figure out the core meaning of their life and its
            purposes. Furthermore, this numerology type aids in finding out the
            right direction for the native with accuracy and reliability. In
            all, one can say that Pythagorean numerology is composed of six
            different variations and vibrations of numerology. However, its
            prime focus still remains on the vibrations that our name shall
            produce and its connection with the numbers.
          </p>
          <p>
            Moreover, Pythagorean numerology focuses on six cores of numerology,
            which are taken from the person’s birth date and name. And the six
            cores described in the Pythagorean Numerology are as follows:

          <h3>Life Path Number</h3>
          <p>
            Life path number generally is the prime focus of the Pythagorean
            system. It generally forms an association with the native’s life.
            Also, it helps in revealing how the person’s life shall be in the
            future. Furthermore, these numbers help in recognizing the massive
            influence that a number could hold on the opportunities that would
            be there in the future, along with the challenges and other hurdles.
          </p>
          <p>
            People can calculate the Life path number by simply picking up their
            date of birth and reducing it to a single number. The final number
            would be the life path number.
          </p>
          <h3>Birth Day Number</h3>
          <p>
            As the name suggests, the birth day number generally represents the
            birth date when a person was born. The number is reduced to a single
            digit. However, if the number occurs to be a master number, it
            remains the same. The digit in the end basically forms the
            significant number that shall help the natives frame their whole
            life. Also, it is believed that at some point in their lives, birth
            day number plays a major role to help them seek goodwill and much
            more.
          </p>
          <h3>First Impression Number</h3>
          <p>
            As the name suggests, this number generally gives an idea of how the
            first impression of a person would be on others. By adding the day
            and month of the birthday, one can know the First impression number.
            This number reveals how the other person would think of the native
            when they speak to them the very first time. Also, it helps to
            define how one sees himself as an individual or wishes to represent
            in front of others. The way a native communicates, behaves, or
            defines himself in front of a being for the first and foremost time
            is what the First impression number actually tells.
          </p>
          <h3>Inner Soul Number</h3>
          <p>
            The inner soul number is considered as the third most important
            Pythagorean number in numerology. Many shall know this number with
            the name Soul urge number, Heart desire’s number, and Soul’s desire
            number. It generally reveals how the person is from the inside.
            Considering all the vowels in the name and reducing it to a single
            digit, one can figure out the inner soul number. It also gives a
            clear glimpse of the person’s subconscious desire, which sometimes
            gets ignored in materialism and other engagements. Not just this,
            furthermore it influences the native’s professional and personal
            life and attracts similar people according to personality.
          </p>
          <h3>Character Number</h3>
          <p>
            As much as other numbers are vital in Pythagorean numerology,
            character number or personality are important too. This number is
            calculated by adding all the consonants in the name of the person.
            It is also known as the personality number and reveals how the
            native shall behave when they meet someone new. In simple words, it
            illustrates the outer personality of the person. To calculate the
            character number, the person has to figure out all the consonants in
            the name and reduce it to a single digit. That digit would be the
            personality number of that person.
          </p>
          <h3>Expression Number</h3>
          <p>
            The expression number is also known as the destiny number. It
            utilizes the full birth name to calculate it. It helps the person to
            know the strengths and weaknesses that they have acquired since
            birth. Moreover, it also aids the folks to know the hidden skills
            that they possess in their life. It also lets the native know about
            the obstacles that they may need to overcome in their lives. Along
            with it, the Expression number also aids in learning skills that
            shall act worthwhile in the life of a person to achieve their goals
            and aims.
          </p>
          <h3>Positive and negative energy of the Pythagorean numerology</h3>
          <p>
            Generally, people approach knowing about these numbers to figure out
            their compatibility with other people, friends, family, strangers,
            etc. Thus, possessing accurate Pythagorean numerology would help
            people know how harmonious their lives would be with their known
            ones.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, sometimes folks don’t get along with others even if they
            have a compatible life path number with their loved ones. It is
            because each number possesses positive and negative vibes that are
            closely associated with all the Pythagorean numbers in numerology.
          </p>
          <p>
            There could be a possibility that a person might help figure out the
            negative energy of a person as it would be what the other person
            shall expect and feel about the native. However, some might help
            seek the positive traits and expression in a native, as they
            perceive that kind of energy from them. So in all, once a person
            gets to know another one, various patterns and combinations start
            forming, which help the native understand and build the future
            accordingly.
