          <h3>Number 1 in Numerology: Meaning, Characteristics and More</h3>
          <p>
            Numerology brings out the essence in numbers. As per numerology,
            each and every number has a meaning hidden in itself. And having
            been born under the influence of a particular number transfers the
            characteristics of that number into the person. In fact, Numerology
            is sometimes termed as the simplest form of astrology as it involves
            future predictions of the native based on numbers. And what are
            these numbers?
          </p>

          <p>
            Certainly, the numerological number associated with you is derived
            from your date of birth and in fact, you can find your lucky number
            as per numerology without needing any help from the astrologer. In
            fact, predicting the future of a native through numerology simply
            involves knowing your life path number and what the number actually
            means. And how do we find what number belongs to us? Well, let's
            take an example.
          </p>

          <p>
            Assume that your date of birth is 1st January 1970. So, when finding
            the life path number for a particular birth date, we first need to
            add all the digits given in the date. Doing so (1+1+1+9+7+0) will
            give you the answer 19. The number then needs to be reduced to a
            single-digit number by again adding 1+9 is 10. Again, to reduce it
            to a single 1+0 answer is 1.
          </p>

          <p>
            Now that the single-digit number that you got is 1, it is your lucky
            number as per numerology. Now, all you need to do is learn or make
            yourself aware of what life path number 1 means in astrology and by
            doing so, you will be able to predict the future for yourself.
            Weren't we right? Isn't numerology one of the easiest ways to
            predict one's characteristics or future? Having said that, let's
            find out what the number 1 in numerology means.
          </p>

          <h3>Numerology Number 1 Personality Traits</h3>
          <p>
            Being born with Number 1 as your life path number in itself sounds
            like an achievement because it is what it is, Number 1. Yet, the
            number comes with its own negatives and positives, which are
            reflected in the human born with the number 1 as per numerology. Any
            native born with life path number 1 is known for his/her penchant to
            lead from the front in whatever way possible. The leadership skills
            are what make them independent and confident. The people born with 1
            as their lucky number want to take charge of anything and everything
            in life. They typically can't rely on others and would always doubt
            a task that is associated with them but wasn't done by them. These
            people like to have control and awareness about everything going on
            around them.
          </p>

          <p>
            The number 1 in numerology signifies self. And thus, can even make
            the person a tad bit selfish. On the positive side, indulgence in
            oneself also boasts a native's maturity and self-awareness. Hence,
            people born with 1 as their lucky number are usually able to take
            more mature decisions in life. Self-reliance and self-appreciation
            are the other two qualities of these natives, which help them in
            having positive growth. The maturity of these natives also ensures
            long-lasting love bonds as people truly look out for what they are
            inside rather than what they are outside.
          </p>

          <p>
            The native born in Number 1 as per numerology is also very patient
            towards life. S/he believes in taking one step at a time and doesn't
            hurry things out. By doing so, the native is able to make better
            choices and learns to cherish the smaller things in life. Also,
            taking baby steps in life better prepares them to meet their
            competitive desires. The time they give themselves allows them to
            work on new ideas, which win them the recognition they deserve.
          </p>

          <p>
            The best thing about the people born with 1 as their life path
            number is that they don't let others influence their life decisions.
            They work on themselves without getting influenced by what others
            are up to and remain self-reliant.
          </p>

          <p>
            Some negative traits that the native born in number 1 can work on
            are reining your longing to meet some unreasonable desires of yours.
            Doing so will save you time. You need to realise when you need to
            stop instead of just pushing yourself into something just because
            you started it. Also, when it comes to people, you need to drop the
            arrogant behaviour and try to be more cooperative with others.
          </p>

          <h3>Numerology Number 1 in Career</h3>
          <p>
            Like we said, people born with 1 as their Life path numbers like to
            lead from the front. So practically, they may work under management
            in the initial stages of life, but in the long term, these natives
            are most likely to have something of their own to help themselves
            cherish being financially independent. If not, they may not feel
            satisfied with life, the effect of which will also reflect in their
            other aspects of their life such as love, marriage, health and
            whatnot.
          </p>

          <p>
            As per numerology, the natives born with 1 as their life path number
            are the happiest when bringing new ideas to the table. Hence
            anything that is not repetitive in terms of profession is what suits
            them in the long term. Having said that, practising law and
            freelance creative work suits these natives. Trying hands at
            marketing too will bring you applause. Also, any creative field
            associated with media, painting, etc is good for you. You can be an
            entrepreneur and prove to be self-made as you are a person who is
            more about Self and Self only. Working closely with your boss may
            not be your cup of tea. Be your own boss.
          </p>

          <h3>Numerology Number 1 in Love</h3>
          <p>
            Natives born with 1 as their life path number are born leaders and
            like to take charge of their life in every aspect, with love being
            no exception. Hence, when in love, these natives can get really
            dominating in nature, which can hamper their relationship
            negatively. The dominating nature will further become the reason for
            their worry if they happen to date a person who also got 1 as their
            lucky number, as per numerology. Both these natives will then try to
            lead over each other and will have an inflammatory ego as well. The
            self-centred characteristics of the couple will make it tough for
            them to lead a happy married life.
          </p>

          <p>
            However, this altogether doesn’t mean that life path number 1
            natives will never enjoy love and marital bliss. In fact, if the
            people born with 1 as their lucky number forge a relationship with
            life paths number 3, 5 or 6, then they are likely to have a happy
            and successful marriage. Also, despite having a dominating nature,
            having maturity in the kitty allows these natives to adapt to people
            well.
          </p>

          <p>
            A major point to make here is the fact that if the person born with
            a life path number 1 has chosen someone, he or she can go to any
            extent to protect them. As dedicated as they are in terms of work,
            the same dedication they are able to practise in their love life as
            well. However, they will always be overly dedicated to their work
            which may hinder their family life to some extent. Hence, you always
            certainly need to work on ensuring that your partner doesn't feel
            aloof or left out. Also, though these people are not habitual of
            seeking attention, but once they begin to get a lot of it, they
            become habitual to it.
          </p>

          <p>
            When it comes to married life, as the natives like to lead, they
            will always have the tendency to make family decisions. They try to
            behave like a boss at home, which is a habit not appreciated by all
            and may even result in friction in a relationship. For this reason,
            they are often called obdurate and egoistic. The most suitable life
            partner for these natives would be anyone from the life path number
            3 or 5. Here the native born with 3 as their lucky number is
            light-hearted and hence can handle 1's serious nature. Meanwhile, 5
            is adventurous and ensures that 1 is not too serious about life.
