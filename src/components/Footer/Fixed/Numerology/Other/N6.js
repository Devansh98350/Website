            and stars to explain cosmic processes. Another branch, called
            Numerology, is similar. Numerology is the study of numbers ranging
            from 1 to 9 as well as additional unique numbers such as 11, 22, and
            33. Every number is said to have some creative power, and these

            </ListItem>
            <ListItem>
              They have a big heart, but only to a point, and it doesn't always
              convert into aid and kindness.
            </ListItem>
            <ListItem>

              They are vulnerable to people's bad intentions and might incur
              significant losses. They have a flaw in that they can't stand
              being alone, which is presumably why they're always looking for
