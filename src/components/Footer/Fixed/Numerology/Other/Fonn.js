          <h3>Food and Numerology</h3>
          <p>
            The spiritual and physiological importance of food is well mentioned
            within the ancient sciences. It is a matter of everything from
            Ayurveda to even numerology. Food is the very source of life. It is
            the sustenance that keeps everything alive. Everything living being
            needs within it is not just food, but good food. It nourishes the
            body, protects it, and makes it resilient against the challenges it
            might face.
          </p>
          <p>
            Many are surprised to know that numerology also recommends the kind
            of food these numbers should eat and the ones that will benefit
            them.
          </p>
          <p>Here is how numerology is connected with food.</p>

          <h3>Numerology number 1 for food</h3>
          <p>
            Numerology number 1 people are ruled by the life-giving and
            nurturing planet, Sun. They should include more orange and yellow
            colour foods in their diet. Therefore, fruits like orange, banana,
            yellow capsicum, lemon, carrot, sunflower seeds, mango, corn,
            pumpkin, grapefruit, squash, peaches, and apricot would be great for
            them.
          </p>
          <p>
            These natives can energise themselves by incorporating spices such
            as ginger, bay, cloves, saffron, nutmeg, honey, and chamomile. They
            should not consume hot food and eat food in its raw forms like
            fruits and lightly cooked curries. It is suggested they drink more
            water; it will help cool them off. They should fill themselves up
            with the solar energy of their master planets.
          </p>

          <h3>Numerology number 2 for food</h3>
          <p>
            Number 2 personalities are recommended to always consume fresh,
            fragrant, and hot food, as their ruling planet is the Moon. Thus, to
            balance the dull elements in their bodies, they must have cucumber,
            white and yellow pumpkin, flaxseed, cabbage, melon, sprouting onion,
            and bananas. Fresh cabbage juice will help with the stomach and
            digestive tract, which people with number 2 in numerology often
            suffer from.
          </p>
          <p>
            Moreover, cucumber juice will bring them immense relief. Half a cup
            in the morning on an empty stomach of cabbage-cucumber juice and
            they do not have to be afraid of ulcers or stones. They should also
            drink grapes, coconut milk, almond milk, endive, rapeseed oil, flax,
            and fennel.

            fruits and vegetables and hot spices suit them well. Mars energy
            supports grapes, strawberries, cranberries, mountain ash, fig, and
            red apples. Vegetables preferred for them are beets, leeks, onions,
            garlic, peppers of all kinds, horseradish, rhubarb, etc.
          </p>
