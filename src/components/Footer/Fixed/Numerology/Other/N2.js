          <h3>Number 2 in Numerology: Meaning, Characteristics and More</h3>
          <p>
            Do you ever feel that you have a connection with a number? Like at
            times, we tend to see a number and see a lot of it. Going by
            experience, some people see 11:11 a lot. Likewise, you too might be
            seeing a lot of a particular number whenever you look at the time or
            simply at anything in your vicinity. So, what is coincidence all
            about? Well, maybe the number that you are seeing too often is
            simply your lucky number or what we call astrologically, your life
            path number.
          </p>

          <p>
            Numerology is the system of numbers, something that has existed in
            the world for thousands of years. As per numerology, each number has
            some hidden characteristics and having been born with that number
            allows the native those particular characteristics. So once you know
            the lucky number of any native around you, you can very likely come
            to know a lot about him and her. The lucky numbers that you can have
            as per numerology span from 1 to 9. And how to know what's your
            lucky number as per numerology? Well, there is a simple way to find
            that out.
          </p>

          <p>
            To start with, let us assume that your date of birth is 1st January
            1970. So, when finding your lucky number as per numerology for a
            particular birth date, you first need to add all the digits in the
            given birth date. Doing so (1+1+1+9+7+0) will give you the answer
            19. The number then needs to be reduced to a single-digit number by
            adding it again and again until you don't arrive at a single-digit
            number. So adding 1+9 is 10. Again, to reduce it to a single 1+0
            answer is 1.
          </p>

          <p>
            Using the above example, we come to know that anyone born on 1st
            January 1970 will have 1 as their lucky number. Well, but here in
            this write-up, we will talk about the lucky number 2 as per
            astrology. If adding your birth date gives you 2 as your lucky
            number, then everything mentioned in this write up is what defines
            you. Right from your likes to personality traits, the lucky path
            number can help you either know yourself better or simply anyone
            close to you. Isn't this system of astrology fun and simple to
            learn. Having said that, let's find out what number 2 in numerology
            means.
          </p>

          <h3>Numerology Number 2 Personality Traits</h3>
          <p>
            The native born with 2 as their lucky number as per numerology is
            very patient in nature. They have a calm and soothing personality,
            which is usually liked by many and thus they prove to be dependable
            to others. In any scenario, these natives can bond well with others
            and remain quite popular in a group. However, as you struggle at
            saying NO to others, this can lead to you burdening yourself with
            responsibilities that do nothing good to you. Also, you need to be
            wary of people who barge into your life just to use you. Though you
            understand the needs of others quite well, but at times you need to
            listen to your heart as well, i.e. learn to say no.
          </p>

          <p>
            Being born with 2 as your lucky number as per numerology also makes
            you peaceful with others, which is an excellent quality to possess.
            Having this quality ensures you a great bonding with your family and
            you will also be able to enjoy your love life to the fullest. The
            peaceful nature also brings in you the taste for music, poetry and
            aesthetics. The peace trait also makes you an introvert, which is
            not the best quality to have as it infringes on your social capital.
          </p>

          <p>
            As someone born with 2 as your lucky number, you are into good
            manners, charm and elegance. You are also a perfectionist, who likes
            everything well placed be it their stuff or relationships in life.
            Talking about relationships, you may have trust issues when it comes
            to your partner as you have a tendency to think that you are not
            enough for them. While this is absolutely wrong, but you will only
            believe it if your partner's actions make you believe it. However,
            you sometimes need to rein this over-sensitive nature of yours as
            not everyone would find it cute to babysit you.
          </p>

          <h3>Numerology Number 2 in Love</h3>
          <p>
            When it comes to love, dating the native-born with 2 as their lucky
            number is having yourself a constant mate to get pampered by. And
            trust me, we can always use some pampering. In love, you know how to
            make it through the tough phases of life and thus usually enjoy a
            long-lasting relationship. As a harmonious being, you are not into
            flings and are only up for loyal relationships in life. Hence, if
            the native born with this lucky number come across people who are
            too modern when it comes to love, these natives will likely distance
            themselves from them. You need to go slow and show traits of being
            an old school romantic if you wish to date people born with 2 as
            their lucky number as per numerology.
          </p>

          <p>
            Overall, you are good at relationships, but you find it difficult to
            find a true partner just like you. In fact, you have a set of
            'requirements' which you invariably want to tick off before you can
            commit to anyone. If your partner is enabled to decipher your cues,
            you can hesitate to speak your mind which may lead to a feeling of
            resentment.
          </p>

          <p>
            Speaking of compatibility, the native with the number 2 as their
            life path finds a compatible life partner in people with numbers 8,
            9 or fellow 2, as their lucky number as per numerology. These are
            the numbers that can understand you and support you emotionally
            besides giving back the pamper that you give to others.
          </p>

          <h3>Numerology Number 2 in Career</h3>
          <p>
            As you are an emotional being, you will be able to be good at
            creative fields such as print, media, advertising, etc. Also,
            because of your innate skill of communicating, the role of an anchor
            might also suit you. Also, due to your emotional character, you are
            able to defuse tense situations and thus can be a good diplomat,
            social worker or teacher of young children. And if you add a little
            confidence to your personality, then as a lawyer and politician you
            can serve peopleâ€™s desires and lead a very fulfilling life
            professionally.
          </p>

          <p>
            You can also achieve greatness in the field of art, like writing,
            creative art, and biology. However, one thing to note here is that
            you have a constant desire for change when it comes to your work.
            And hence you may feel very lethargic about doing the same task
            again and again. This will not only reduce your productivity but may
            also hamper your thinking capabilities. The best way to tackle the
            situation is to start something of your own. This can be a full-time
            'own' thing or simply a freelance project about something you enjoy
            doing.
          </p>
