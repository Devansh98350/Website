          <h3>Number 7 in Numerology: Meaning, characteristics and more</h3>
          <p>
            Also known as the spiritual stone, those born under the number 7 are
            really close to God. Those born on the 7th, 16th, and 25th of any
            month fall under the number and their ruling planet is Ketu. It is
            symbolic in the sense that it connects from the bottom of the spine
            to the third eye which is in the middle of the eye. The third eye is
            considered to be the gate to the inner self. The number 7 has a
            relationship to the card chariot of the tarot deck, which means that
            people born under this number are logical and introspective. In most
            readings, the card chariot is taken as a victory, which indicates
            that these people are lucky in terms of fortune. They have healing
            qualities within them and do need much help from others. They work
            best when they are left alone.
          </p>

          <p>
            An interesting point to notice here is that 7 is a prime number
            which can be broken down into 3 (creativity) and 4 (practicality).
            People belonging to this number are considered to be serious in
            nature with leading qualities and are quite short with their
            answers. They like the attention that they receive.
          </p>

          <h3>Numerology number 7 Personality Traits</h3>
          <p>
            If you made the calculations and have discovered that you fall under
            number 7, you are a special person as you don’t like anything extra
            and like everything to be plain and simple. Although you have
            emasculated taste. You like to be alone most of the time, and people
            may call you a loner. Usually isolating yourself from the rest of
            the world, you do not like oversharing and very rarely open up about
            your true feelings. The biggest struggle of your life is that you
            think too much and ponder on every minor thing and end up losing
            your patience frequently.
          </p>

          <p>
            There is a peculiarity in the personality of this number as you
            could have a deep appreciation for the fine arts but there are also
            those belonging to the same number that consider arts an unnecessary
            thing. You might often find yourself in a difficult situation
            because you are opposed to something that was liked by a bigger
            number of people because people belonging to this number do not fear
            speaking up if they don’t find something appealing. Physically there
            is nothing that strikes someone but you do have good looking
            features such as a tall physique and curved nose and high eyebrows.
          </p>

          <p>
            Personality wise, people consider you to have a strong mental
            capacity and commend your innovative ideas. Your independence lets
            you explore your creativity, through which you come up with bold
            ideas and thoughts. Because of your creativity and bold take on
            things, you can make a huge name for yourself with memorable
            achievements. But it is not luck that gives you all the fake,
            because lady luck is not in favour most of the time. It is your
            dedication and hard work towards everything that you do that gets
            recognised and appreciated.
          </p>

          <h3>Numerology number 7 in Career</h3>
          <p>
            Being able to work in a foreign country entices you very much as you
            usually choose jobs that will let you stay abroad. Traveling is a
            big thing for you in your career and you find it fairly easy to stay
            away from home for a long period of time as you are very independent
            and take smart decisions in dire situations. As you like to be the
            authority figure in everything, working under someone and heeding
            their commands does not suit you at all.
          </p>

          <p>
            Everything you do, you put your heart and soul into it. No one can
            say that they have seen something similar to your work because being
            original is what you live for. Being kind-hearted and giving, you
            have the blessings of everyone you helped and will live a life of
            comfort and joy. Since luck is rarely with you, you do get success
            easily and are always struggling to make your work recognised, even
            if you have great potential.
          </p>

          <p>
            People belonging to this number usually fail to get a job that they
            truly desire and have an unfulfilling work life. The most suitable
            professions for you are being a teacher or a philosopher. You can
            also look into acting as your career as it suits your personality of
            being bold and creative.
          </p>

          <h3>Numerology number 7 in Love</h3>
          <p>
            In terms of love and romantic relationships, if you belong to this
            number, you do not like to play games. Being in a relationship is
            not a joke for you and you take your lover very seriously. If you
            are a female, you rarely show any public display of affection, but
            your love shouldn’t be taken for granted as your is true and
            sincere. Because of your sensitive nature and your seriousness about
            love, there are chances that you might decide never to get married
            as you hide most of your affections.
          </p>

          <p>
            You do need to understand that you have to sometimes open up about
            your true feelings when you are dating someone because your lofty
            behaviour might give them the wrong impression that you are not as
            interested in them as they are in you. Remember, the relationship is
            all about trust and communication. Without them, you cannot make a
            relationship work. The best numbers that are compatible with you are
            3 and 5. If you are actually looking to get married, you are lucky
            on that front as the family you are marrying into will be extremely
            rich and prosperous and your in-laws will have a strong social
            position.
          </p>

          <p>
            Children are not the strongest suit for you as you do not like their
            company, but when it comes to your own kids, you will love them with
            everything you have and will do anything for them. Being a
            self-proclaimed introvert, getting along with new people is not
            something you are comfortable with and you avoid strangers as much
            as possible. So your friend circle is not very big with only two to
            three people. But the good thing about it is that your small group
            of friends are your biggest supporters and you have a very good
            relationship with them. Your friends are more or less similar to you
            as you like intellectual and smart people who can be helpful to you
            and will be with you in hard times.
          </p>

          <h3>Strengths and Weaknesses of number 7 in Numerology</h3>
          <p>
            Being ruled by the planet Ketu which is the south node of the moon,
            there is a sense of negative energy flowing as an effect of the said
            planet. Ketu is referred to as the “shadow planet” and just like the
            name, it brings malefic effects on the people falling under it.
            These people will very frequently have to go through difficult times
            as Ketu is a hard planet to overcome. These people can suffer from
            mindlessness and confusion that can stray them from their path.
          </p>

            <ListItem>
              Your intellectuality surpasses everyone else as you have a
              brilliant mind and are sharp-witted. When involved in any project,
              your performance surprises everyone because of your creativity and
              innovation. The ideas you come up with are original and unique,
              and you hate monotone. You have a certain interest in metaphysics
              and occult sciences.
            </ListItem>
            <ListItem>
              From a very young age, your spiritual journey has begun, and
              because of that, you are in tune with your inner self and your
              Psych. You are very religious and find refuge in your spiritual
              zone. Doing a mediocre job is not an option for you, no matter how
              trivial the task is. Once a topic catches your interest, you will
              not be satisfied until you uncover every aspect of that thing.
            </ListItem>
            <ListItem>
              Justice is very important for you, and keeping everything fair and
              square is your real motive. Your strict way of living gives you
              true meaning and purpose. You follow a routine to live your life,
              and that gives you comfort.
            </ListItem>
            <ListItem>
              There is a sense of comfort one feels when they are around you
              because you make them feel important and emphasize their emotions.
            </ListItem>
            <ListItem>
              Because of your intuition, you tap into their conscience and are
              able to help them in their healing journey.

          </UnorderedList>
          <h3>Weakness</h3>
          <UnorderedList>
            <ListItem>
              The fact that you are always so closed off and keep all your
              feelings bottled up makes you difficult to deal with. Because of
              this, people around you that care for you don’t get any clear
              message of your true feelings which ultimately creates
              misunderstandings. Try opening up a bit more so that you don’t
              hurt those you love, even unintentionally.
            </ListItem>
            <ListItem>
              The fact that you are highly knowledgeable and experienced is
              appreciated by people around you. But don’t let that fact rule you
              and make you look like you know it all. Try not to be as critical
              and opinionated about everything and let others find their own
              path.
            </ListItem>
            <ListItem>
              You can be intimidating to others since you stay in your own
              bubble and rarely show interest in someone else’s business. People
              will get more interested to be with you and try to get to know you
              if you show them your true self and open up.
