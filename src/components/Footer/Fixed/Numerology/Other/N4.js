          <h3>Number 4 in Numerology: Meaning, characteristics and more</h3>
          <p>
            People born on the 14th, 22nd, and 31st of any given month are said
            to be ruled by the numerology number 4. They are ruled by the planet
            Rahu (the Lunar North Node). The number is considered to be lucky
            for zodiac signs Leo and Scorpio. Also associated with the Emperor
            in Tarot Cards, numerology number 4 is connected to worldly
            authority, power, kingship, rule, stability, and discipline. They
            represent consistency and discipline. Since everything is said to be
            made of four elements, they have a special place in creation as
            well. Moreover, as per numerology, it is also considered to have
            feminine energy.
          </p>
          <p>
            Lord Rahu is seen as rather powerful in astrology. However the same
            is not reflected in numerology. Rahu is considered to be less
            powerful in the aspects of the numbers, to say. The strength of
            Number 4 in numerology is hence believed to be less when compared to
            other numbers. Numerologists consider the number 4 people to be
            ruled by the planet Uranus. Number four’s symbolism shows us the
            necessity of stability for creating anything worthwhile. It is the
            number that comes after number 3 and has surprisingly strikingly
            opposite energy to its predecessor. One of the most visible
            characteristics of numerology number 4 is that individuals tend to
            be pragmatic and have rational thinking as opposed to the optimists
            and artists of the previous number.
          </p>
          <h3>Numerology Number 4 Personality Traits</h3>
          <p>
            They are the workaholics and the worker bees of the universe. People
            under this birth number are highly analytical, practical, social,
            and even social reformers. These people are the perfect combination
            of traditional values and modern practices. Punctuality and
            consistency are some of their best qualities. Do not ever expect
            them to give up easily. Their views are rarely ever similar to the
            views of most of the other people around them; they do not believe
            in something simply because the majority believes it.
          </p>
          <p>
            They have their different perspectives, and their views are opposite
            to the views of others, and they tend to owe this proudly. They are
            aggressive, blunt, forward, and extroverts. Many of them have an
            excessive habit of criticizing. They are vigilant and cautious while
            making any decisions. Generally, they are not money-oriented.
          </p>
          <p>
            Numerology number 4 people are indifferent about money and wealth
            and are way more concerned with the pursuit of knowledge. They are
            great savers and are wise with investments and savings. These
            individuals are hard-working as well as determined. They do not
            believe in adopting shortcuts with a professional attitude. They
            have a purposeful approach to life. They are both learners and
            teachers.
          </p>
          <h3>Numerology Number 4 in Career</h3>
          <p>
            Since they are analytical and know how to distribute, they can
            divide work and team up with people. Some of the fields where number
            four can excel are legal, science, agriculture, management, and
            banking. They excel at any job to which they put their mind.
            Success-oriented and loyal, they may find extraordinary success.
            Unfortunately, they may attribute it to just luck and not their hard
            work.
          </p>
          <p>
            Number 4s do not find it easy to take credit even when they deserve
            it. This number in numerology finds itself in accounting jobs, as
            facilitators, personal assistants, almost anything and anywhere that
            their organizational mind can shine.
          </p>
          <p>
            They never fall prey to money schemes since with their analytical
            mind it is almost impossible to betray them. They care about
            justice. It might lead to work in law enforcement.
          </p>
          <p>
            They do well in detail-considered jobs. IT and Real Estate are other
            great options for them.
          </p>
          <h3>Numerology Number 4 in Love</h3>
          <p>
            They are inept when it comes to handling love, relationships, and
            matters of the heart. They take time to open up and are even loners
            to confess their true feelings and desires. Fortunately, once they
            fall in love, they stay rooted and devoted. They maintain the
            integrity of their relationships, and fidelity is in their nature.
          </p>
          <p>
            While passion and sensuality are not number four’s primary virtue,
            they make up for it with their devotion. Number 4 personalities are
            best compatible with numbers 5, 6, and 8. Individuals who want
            stability over adventure naturally find themselves attracted to 4,
            who are very compassionate to those with whom they choose to share a
            day or a lifetime.
          </p>
          <p>
            The biggest challenge for number 4 people is expressing what they
            feel since their emotions are very closed off. With patience and
            stability, their love lives can flourish.
          </p>

              down to earth. They like to find every detail of the things they
              want to know about. They refuse to live in a dreamy world and
              address the needs of reality.
            </ListItem>

              They are always learning new things and surround themselves with
              similar individuals. Also, they are always learning new skills or
              becoming good at existing ones.
            </ListItem>
            <ListItem>
              These people are great planners and managers. They also love
              organizing things. Their analytical nature helps them deal with
              problems before they arise. They are quick to create solutions for
              their hurdles too.
            </ListItem>
            <ListItem>
              Most of the time, their views are very different from the views of
              most other people. They have different perspectives, and their
              views are opposite to the views of others.
            </ListItem>
            <ListItem>
              These individuals own their views and ideas and refuse to simply
              gang with the crowd. So, one can say that these natives love to
              stand on their own and take ownership of their perceptions.
            </ListItem>
            <ListItem>
              Number 4 people have the prominent habit of seeing and showing the
              opposite side of the coin. They dare to put their opposite views
              and cross-questions during discussions.
            </ListItem>
          </UnorderedList>
          <p>
            <strong>Weakness</strong>
          </p>
          <UnorderedList>
            <ListItem>
              They are inflexible, rigid, and obstinate. These natives may
              become intolerant and judgmental.
            </ListItem>
            <ListItem>
              Another weakness of these people is that they are short-tempered
              and abrupt. They have a high degree of ego, so it is never easy to
              convince them of anything.
            </ListItem>
            <ListItem>
              Because of their serious approach towards everything, many times
              they miss the enjoyment of life. They cannot adjust with others if
              others are not of their type; it is their way or the high way.
            </ListItem>
            <ListItem>
              While they are slow to anger in general, they become very strong
              while defending their ideas and may come off as egotistical and
              aggressive. They can make many enemies due to their tendency of
              being so defensive.
            </ListItem>
            <ListItem>
              They have a very rigid idea of perfection and always meet it but
              sometimes cannot, which leads to a lot of disappointment in their
              hearts. Number 4 people also expect the same standards of
              perfection in others and conflicts arise when they see the people
              around them failing to meet them.
            </ListItem>
          </UnorderedList>
          <h3>Lucky Colour and Gemstone</h3>
          <p>
            Numerology number 4 people plan everything in advance. Therefore, it
            is practically second nature to them. They refuse to start anything
            without a plan in place, and there is no negotiation about adjusting
            to it. There is no fear of challenges here, but that can also be
            negative because they might take on more than they can handle.
          </p>
          <p>
            They may suffer from sleep issues because their minds don’t want to
            shut down and potentially lose a great idea. Overall, they should
            learn to loosen up a little, or they might end up missing precious
            moments in life. Thus, their lucky gemstones are Gomed and
            Hessonite. As for their lucky colour, it is usually shades of blue,
            green, and sometimes red.
