          <h3>Finance and Numerology</h3>
          <p>
            Material comfort is required for everyone to live a satisfactory
            life. This is when money comes in. Monetary energy is vital for
            anything and everything. Hence people are always on the hunt for
            ways to attract money. Esotericism is something that is followed by
            many where both the energies of money and numbers interact.
            Numerology can be considered close to science when it comes to
            financing because one might have noticed the numbers on the notes in
            the bank, such as nominal value and serial number. If used
            correctly, the numbers and their energy can be used to attract
            money. Let’s look at all the numerology numbers and their
            association with money.
          </p>

          <p>
            According to Hindu ancient scriptures, the Lifepath of a person is
            determined by the numbers they are born under. The birth number of a
            person is determined by calculating the date, month, and year of the
            person’s birthday. Through this number, one would be able to
            identify their purpose in life and what the future holds for them.
          </p>

          <p>
            Here we have all the numerological numbers and their relationship
            with money and finance.
          </p>

          <h3>Money Number 1 in Numerology</h3>
          <p>
            The people born under this number will prosper financially and will
            not have to struggle when it comes to money. You will generally have
            good health because you will be able to input more energy into your
            work, and will be rewarded with good revenue. Make sure to always
            stay humble and avoid overconfidence or anger for never-ending
            success. If you are struggling to make wealth, try consuming
            something sweet every Sunday to attract wealth. They will not take
            the responsibility if they ever need to take a loan and will blame
            others. They will give back the money in advance to the person they
            are indebted to.
          </p>

          <h3>Money Number 2 in Numerology</h3>
          <p>
            Earning money for you is a bit more difficult task than others
            because you do not take the steps required to earn it. Your will is
            not strong enough. So even if you make good plans, you fail to
            execute them because you don’t commit to them. Your sincerity to
            others never lets you upset them and you end up causing a loss for
            yourself by trying to avoid causing harm to them. Try keeping fasts
            on Mondays to attract money. You just have bad luck with money and
            will not receive it without working for it. Only hard work can lead
            to success for you. Inherited wealth is also a gray area for you.
          </p>

          <h3>Money Number 3 in Numerology</h3>
          <p>
            People falling under this number will have fortune regarding money,
            but they will also have to go through difficulties. You have good
            wisdom and knowledge and can use that to attract money. Being good
            with people is also one of your strengths and that will help you
            climb the social ladder. Although it is known that with highs there
            will also come lows, so you should try to avoid illegal business
            absolutely. On Thursdays, try wearing yellow clothes to ward off bad
            luck and to get wealth.
          </p>

          <h3>Money Number 4 in Numerology</h3>
          <p>
            Earning money can become very hard for you because you are not lucky
            in that aspect. But you are also hard-working and determined and
            don’t let failure pull you down. Easy money is not your thing and
            you’ve gotten used to it by now. Sheer hard work will get you
            financial satisfaction and wealth. Try avoiding negative thoughts as
            much as possible and stay optimistic at all times. Worshiping Lord
            Ganesha is something you should do to ward off negative energy.
          </p>

          <h3>Money Number 5 in Numerology</h3>
          <p>
            People belonging to this number are good in the field of business
            and can grow their business really fast with strategic thinking.
            Your logical way of thinking is best utilized in intellect and
            engineering pursuits. Employers working under you will have a good
            experience working with you as you will treat them as your equal and
            give them the opportunity to grow. Try to keep your mind calm and
            subdued to not let yourself get overwhelmed. To draw in success,
            feed grass or jaggery to cows every Wednesday.
          </p>

          <h3>Money Number 6 in Numerology</h3>
          <p>
            Considered to be the money attracting number, people falling under
            this will have the most luck when it comes to monetary wealth. You
            will probably get a huge sum by inheritance. Money will never be
            short and you will have a very comfortable life. But try controlling
            your expenses and make decisions rationally. Your thirst for luxury
            can cause problems in the future. Eating sweets on Thursdays will
            bring fortune and luck.
          </p>

          <h3>Money Number 7 in Numerology</h3>
          <p>
            Two different scenarios arise when it comes to the number 7 and
            money. Either they are rich or they lose money more than anyone.
            Your ambition is a good thing for you and you should put that to use
            by acting on the plans you created. But try avoiding doing anything
            reckless like gambling or venturing into a new business without much
            evaluation as that can lead to loss of money. But there are also
            chances that once you start earning money, no one can stop that
            until you become a millionaire. Feeding black dogs with food made
            out of flour to attract fortune.
          </p>

          <h3>Money Number 8 in Numerology</h3>
          <p>
            People with this number will have good luck with money but it more
            or less depends on the way they handle certain situations. Having an
            optimistic approach to life is necessary for you as that will
            determine your future. Don’t give up on the first trial and learn to
            overcome failure. Hard work is key when it comes to earning money
            and you will become rich through your brains rather than brawn. Try
            to give your brain a rest when things seem to overcome you and try
            avoiding negativity as much as possible. For good fortune and
            prosperity, try lighting a ghee lamp under a Peepal tree.
          </p>

          <h3>Money Number 9 in Numerology</h3>
          <p>
            Money is not a concern for this number and is in general quite
            fortune in terms of wealth. “Midas Touch” is closely related to the
            people under the number 9. You will find it very easy to draw in
            money even with the least amount of effort, like a gift or a
            lottery. You, in general, are very career-driven and have a high
            amount of energy and enthusiasm for your job, and will receive good
            results. To bring positive energy and to ward off misfortunes,
            recite Hanuman Chalisa every Tuesday.
