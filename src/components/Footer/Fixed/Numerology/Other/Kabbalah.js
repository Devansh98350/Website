            Kabbalah numerology: Calculation method using energy and vibrations
          </h2>
          <p>
            Kabbalah numerology came into activity from Judaism. However, it
            holds immense importance in mysticism. The foundation of this type
            of numerology is pretty easy to understand. It says that everything
            in this world exists in the form of vibes, vibrations, frequencies,
            and energies. It forms the primary and sole source of existence, and
            as humans, each individual adds some form of energy to it on a daily
            basis.
          </p>
          <p>
            Moreover, according to Kabbalah numerology, the name of the person
            is as important as numbers. These letters hold their initiation from
            the Hebrew alphabet. However, further calculations are done by
            looking at the birth name of the person. It helps to resolve
            challenges and issues in the life of the native and changes their
            energy from negative to positive, helping them sync with the
            Universe.
          </p>
          <h3>Vibrations and energy of Kabbalah numerology</h3>
          <p>
            According to Kabbalah numerology, everything starts with vibrations
            and energies. These vibrations play differently for each native.
            Below are the names of the energies that form the Kabbalah
            numerology:
          </p>
          <UnorderedList>
            <ListItem>Kether</ListItem>
            <ListItem>Chokhmah</ListItem>
            <ListItem>Binah</ListItem>
            <ListItem>Chesed</ListItem>
            <ListItem>Geburah</ListItem>
            <ListItem>Taphareth</ListItem>
            <ListItem>Netzach</ListItem>
            <ListItem>Hod</ListItem>
            <ListItem>Yesod</ListItem>
            <ListItem>Makuth</ListItem>
          </UnorderedList>
          <p>
            The above-mentioned names consist of a total of 22 vibrations. These
            vibrations range from 1 to 400. Moreover, according to this
            numerology branch, each vibration underlines wisdom and knowledge
            that the soul and the mind earn. Also, these vibrations exist in the
            non-physical world instead of the tangible physical one.
          </p>
          <p>
            Along with it, these energies also involve a great level of
            understanding that cuts across all the physical boundaries and
            limitations to understand the personality and traits of the person.
            Like many other types of numerology, Kabbalah numerology also pays
            importance to the letter and number connection, and predictions are
            made accordingly.

            Decoding each alphabet clarifies that all the numbers have their own
            significance, importance, and meaning. Moreover, each of them
            signifies various traits and characteristics of the native, which
            furthermore, helps in the predictions.
