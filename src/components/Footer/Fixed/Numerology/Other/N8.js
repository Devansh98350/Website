          <h3>Number 8 in Numerology: Meaning, Characteristics and More</h3>
          <p>
            Those born on the dates 8th, 17th, and 26th fall under the
            numerology number 8. Ruled by the planet Saturn, the number 8 is the
            most influential number in numerology and holds great importance.
            Since the shape of 8 is like the infinite sign, it could be depicted
            that the person that falls under this number will reach infinite
            heights and will have the opportunity to gain enormous success, with
            their hard work. The number 8 is also believed to be the balance
            factor between the materialistic and the spiritual aspect of an
            individual. The main focus of this number is to gain success and be
            ambitious at every level of life. Gaining power and authority in
            life’s events is the main function of this number but it also
            provokes generosity.
          </p>

          <p>
            Physically the person belonging to this number is usually of
            mid-height with a narrow forehead and small eyes. They will most
            probably have dark or brown hair and not have a full beard.
          </p>

          <h3>Numerology Number 8 Personality Traits</h3>
          <p>
            If you belong to numerology number 8, you must’ve noticed that you
            tend to get distracted quite easily and it is very hard for you to
            put all your focus and concentration on only one project. You are
            confused with your priorities and are still trying to figure out
            your true self. To complete any task, you need to have steady
            resolve and dedication.
          </p>

          <p>
            People falling under the numerology number 8 are excellent
            administrators. Business for you is a very easy and suitable job.
            Something to note here is that you get too obsessed with success and
            keep dwelling on things that can’t be helped. You love adventure and
            get a thrill when something challenges you, but at the same time you
            might end up doing things without further evaluation that can end
            badly. With a great sense of humor, the people belonging to
            numerology number 8 have a witty personality and are a wonderful
            company. Very rarely will they get overrated or boring, because they
            are very adaptable and accomplished and will change into a person
            appropriate to the environment.
          </p>

          <p>
            Even if you have the best interest in everything and your morality
            never lets you do anything wrong, people tend to misjudge you
            because of the way you put things forward. You have great insight
            and can easily evaluate a situation, but making friends is not your
            best suit. Try not to let your wisdom fuel your ego too much as that
            turns off others and you end up looking like a self-righteous
            person. Unfortunately, the struggle is your old friend, and every
            step of your life is filled with you fighting to maintain your
            position or reach a goal. All this struggle can lead to success, but
            it can also go in vain and you might end up with nothing.
          </p>

          <p>
            There is no guaranteed success for you. People that fall under the
            number 8 can have a short life span as it is believed that their
            mortality rate is not very high. But that doesn’t imply that
            everyone belonging to this number will die early. More than not end
            up having a long and fulfilling life. You can avoid bad luck a lot
            of you associate with those under number 5.
          </p>

          <h3>Numerology Number 8 in Career</h3>
          <p>
            It has already been noted by now that if you fall under the
            numerology number 8, you have a very ambitious personality. And
            nothing is more sweeter and fulfilling to you than being at the top.
            Because of your very good administrative skills, you will most
            definitely end up being in the top position of your job, with you
            having the responsibility to lead and guide those under you. You can
            expect to have a lot of responsibilities and are expected to lead
            the business towards success.
          </p>

          <p>
            The role of the leaders in any field is the most suitable for you.
            Those who have birthdays on the 17th can look for their career in
            the field of economics. As observed before, your sense of judgment
            is spot on and you can come up with solutions in the shortest amount
            of time. Because of this, being a business is very suitable too,
            which is a rare thing because very few people can make it big with
            business. You will earn a good profit if you indulge in trading.
            Some other very good options for you are mining, oil mills, woolen
            clothing, soap printing press, etc.
          </p>

          <p>
            Also, it has been identified that people with the number 8 are
            highly interested in the field of law. It is rare for you to try
            something out of your comfort zone, and will mostly do everything
            that has already been tried and tested. But it is not a bad thing
            since that ensures your success. Since you have always been a
            religious person, you can also see yourself being a preacher or
            priest.
          </p>

          <h3>Numerology Number 8 in Love</h3>
          <p>
            When it comes to relationships with your family, you might have
            always felt like you are on the outside looking in and always get a
            feeling that you don’t belong. Your siblings take you as a person of
            ordinary qualities which do not evoke in them an urge to be close to
            you. Granted you most definitely do not have an ordinary
            personality, but the way you present yourself gives them the wrong
            impression. There is always a pull and push relationship with your
            father as the two of you never see eye to eye. Your mother often
            becomes the victim of your and your father’s conflicts.
          </p>

          <p>
            Love is not the easiest task for you, because forming a strong bond
            with anyone takes a lot of time and patience, which you lack to
            provide when it comes to relationships. For a longer period, you
            will move from one relationship to another, and find it hard to
            settle down. Getting married is more difficult than being in a
            committed relationship because it requires a lifetime of commitment.
            It is not uncommon for those falling under the number 8 to get
            married at an older age than others. But you will surely have a
            successful and loving marriage if you evaluate your cards correctly
            and choose your partners carefully.
          </p>

          <p>
            If the two of you connect at a deeper level and have a mutual
            understanding, you will experience a healthy married life. The most
            suitable partners for you are those that belong to the numbers 1 and
            4. You will also find common ground with the same number as you.
          </p>

          <h3>Strengths and Weaknesses of Number 8 in Numerology</h3>
          <p>
            The number 8 represents everything that’s out of this world and has
            a deep inclination for spirituality within it. Ruled by the most
            ruthless planet, Saturn, this number is more prone to harsh
            situations than other numbers. Also known as the planet of karmic
            matter, Saturn will give you all the fortune and wealth if you
            deserve it. But it can also bestow upon you hardships. It all
            depends on the judgment of your virtue and deeds.
          </p>

          <h3>Strength</h3>
          <UnorderedList>
            <ListItem>
              Some of your strongest points are your judgment and evaluation are
              always on point and you always do everything with a calm demeanor.
              Rushing into things and being impulsive is not your thing, which
              saves you from a lot of trouble.
            </ListItem>
            <ListItem>
              As you very rarely come across good fortune, hard work and
              dedication have brought you where you now stand, and that made you
              strong and resilient. You don’t fall apart at the smallest
              inconvenience because you are used to things not going as you
              plan. You have adapted yourself from misfortunes and now are
              always prepared with plan b.
            </ListItem>
            <ListItem>
              The number 8 is also associated with the rise and fall of a
              career, and that has made you humble and sensitive. Although some
              may think you are indifferent, you are a sensible person and will
              take it to heart if they are misunderstood.
            </ListItem>
            <ListItem>
              Even if you have encountered many misfortunes, your optimism is
              amendable.
            </ListItem>
          </UnorderedList>
          <h3>Weakness</h3>
          <UnorderedList>
            <ListItem>
              As you love to be the leader at everything, it does not sit well
              with you when you have to work under someone. Heeding orders is
              not the most palatable thing for you and you will find it
              difficult to adjust.
            </ListItem>
            <ListItem>
              Since you have a sense of self-righteousness, you believe what you
              know is true and facts and will oppose those who do not have
              similar ideals to yours. This leads to you falling victim to
              problematic situations where you feel trapped. That doesn’t mean
              that you are wrong. You just can't let go of things if you feel it
              is wrong and unjust.
            </ListItem>
            <ListItem>
              Everything should be fair and square for you. But you have to
              understand that there are things that are out of our control, and
              we cannot change them even if they are morally wrong.
            </ListItem>
            <ListItem>
              You might have already noticed that it is very rare that something
              catches your interest or pleases you immensely. It is because you
              don’t find worldly things very fun. It could also mean that
              sometimes you are confused about your true feelings and do not
              know whether you like something or not. This can throw off some
              people as they cannot figure out the kind of person you are.
            </ListItem>
            <ListItem>
              Also, since you are more mature and level-headed than others,
              being in a relationship with you can be hard and sometimes boring,
              especially if the person you are dating is quite younger than you.
              But if you meet someone just as mature as you just not in age but
              mentality, the relationship will go smoothly.
            </ListItem>

          <h3>Lucky Colour and Gemstone for numerology number 8</h3>
          <p>
            Beware of the dates 4th, 13th, 22nd, and 31st as they may bring an
            unpredictable thing, which can very much be good as well as bad.
            Lucky dates for you are 1st, 10th, 19th, and 28th as they will bring
            luck for sure.
          </p>
          <p>
            The color yellow resonates the most with you as it is a very
            auspicious color for you. You can also go for colors like dark green
            and blue as they are a good alternative. Try avoiding the colors
            red, brown, black, or other pale colors as they might not be the
            luckiest.
          </p>
          <p>
            Stones that are blue in color and have six veins are very good for
            you. Examples are blue sapphire and Indra Neelam. They will benefit
            you greatly in terms of wealth, prosperity, and good health.
