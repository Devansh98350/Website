          <p>
            <strong>1. Entrance and Main Door</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            The entrance to your home or workplace is the gateway for energy to
            flow in. Follow these Vastu principles for the main entrance:
          </p>
          <UnorderedList>
            <ListItem>
              <strong>Direction:</strong> Ideally, the main door should face the
              north, northeast, or east direction to allow the flow of positive
              energy into the space. South or southwest-facing doors should be
              avoided.
            </ListItem>
            <ListItem>
              <strong>Clutter-Free Entrance:</strong> Ensure that the entrance
              is clutter-free and well-lit. Remove any obstacles or obstructions
              that may hinder the entry of energy.
            </ListItem>
            <ListItem>
              <strong>Threshold Decor:</strong> Decorate the entrance threshold

              well-maintained door symbolizes opportunities opening up in your
              life.
            </ListItem>
          </UnorderedList>
          <p>
            <strong>2. Interior Layout and Arrangement</strong>
          </p>

            The arrangement of furniture and objects within your living spaces
            can influence the flow of positive energy. Here are some Vastu
            guidelines:

            </ListItem>
            <ListItem>
              <strong> Declutter Regularly:</strong> Regularly declutter your

          <p>
