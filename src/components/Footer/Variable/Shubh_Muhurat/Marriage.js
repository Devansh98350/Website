            Auspicious times to notice in Vivah Shubh Muhurat 2024
          </h2>

          <p>
            In Hindu culture, the choice of an auspicious time, known as Vivah
            Shubh Muhurat, for a wedding is of paramount importance, as it is
            believed to influence the harmony and prosperity of the marital
            union. As we delve into the auspicious times for weddings in 2024,
            we encounter a tapestry of elements that contribute to this sacred
            moment.
          </p>
          <p>
            Karana, the half of a lunar day, plays a pivotal role. Kinstughan,
            Baw, Balav, Kaulav, Taitil, Gharo, and Vanij Karan are considered
            propitious for marriages, ensuring a harmonious beginning.
          </p>
          <p>
            Muhurat, the most auspicious time for a wedding, features Abhijeet
            and Godhuli Vela as ideal moments to tie the knot, ensuring
            blessings for a lifelong journey together.
          </p>
          <p>
            The date holds significance as well. Dwitiya, Tritiya, Panchami,
            Saptami, Ekadashi Tithi, and Trayodashi Tithi are deemed auspicious
            for weddings, promising a prosperous and joyful marital life.
          </p>
          <p>
            Nakshatra, the lunar constellations, are crucial in choosing a date.
            Rohini, Mrigashira, Magha, Uttara Falguni, Hasta, Swati, Anuradha,
            Mool, Uttarashada, Uttara Bhadrapada, and Revati Nakshatras are
            considered favourable for weddings.
          </p>
          <p>
            Selecting the right day is vital too. Monday, Wednesday, Thursday,
            and Friday are auspicious wedding days, while Tuesday is best
            avoided for this sacred occasion.
          </p>
          <p>
            Yoga, the planetary combinations, also plays a significant role.
            Preeti Yoga, Saubhagya Yoga, and Harshana Yoga are believed to bring
            marital bliss and prosperity. In 2024, couples seeking a harmonious
            and prosperous marriage should consult these auspicious factors to
            ensure a joyful and blessed beginning to their lifelong journey
            together.

          <h2>Inauspicious times as per Marriage Muhurat 2024</h2>

          <p>
            The year 2024 presents a challenging landscape for those seeking
            auspicious times for weddings, as per the Marriage Muhurat, an
            important astrological consideration in Hindu culture. Inauspicious

            might prove to be a complex task due to celestial alignments and

            lunar phases, and the alignment of stars to determine the most

            couples may choose to delay their nuptials or seek remedies to
            mitigate unfavourable influences.
          </p>

          <p>
            While the year 2024 may pose challenges in finding ideal Marriage
            Muhurat, its essential to remember that love and commitment can
            transcend astrological considerations. Couples can choose to focus
            on building a strong foundation for their marriage, irrespective of
            the timing, and rely on their bond and support from loved ones to
            navigate through any challenges that may arise.
