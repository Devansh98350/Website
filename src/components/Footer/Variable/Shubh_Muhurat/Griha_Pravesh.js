            The Griha Pravesh Muhurat is determined by astrological
            calculations, taking into consideration the positions of celestial
            bodies and planetary transits. Astrologers believe that the
            alignment of these cosmic forces can impact the energy and
            vibrations of the new home.

            Key factors to consider while choosing a Griha Pravesh Muhurat
            include the date, time, and planetary positions. An astrologer can
            help identify the most favourable time for the ceremony, ensuring
            that it aligns with the family members' birth charts.
