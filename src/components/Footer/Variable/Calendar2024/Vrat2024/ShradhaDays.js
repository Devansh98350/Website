            There is an old saying-“We reap what we sow”. Hindus believe that
            what we do in life affects our future, and this also applies to our
            ancestors. If our ancestors did bad things in their lives, their
            karma may be passed on to us. But by performing Shradh or Pitru
            Paksha rituals, we can help to prevent this from happening. These
            rituals also help to calm our ancestors' souls and make them happy.
          </p>
          <p>
            Pitru Paksha, also known as Shradh, is a Hindu festival that lasts
            16 days and is dedicated to honouring and paying tribute to one's
            ancestors, or pitrus. It is believed that the souls of departed
            ancestors visit their descendants during the month of Ashwin
            (September-October).
          </p>
          <p>
            During this time, Hindus undertake rituals and make offerings of
            food, water, and other items to their ancestors in order to obtain
            their blessings and secure their well-being in the hereafter. It is
            a significant time for seeking forgiveness and conducting charitable
            gestures for those in need. Know what to do on Pitru Paksha (Shradh)
            2025 to seek your ancestors' blessings.

            In the Hindu calendar, tithis are the lunar days. They are
            determined using the moon's location in the sky. A lunar month has

          <h3>Pitru Paksha or Shradh Meaning</h3>
          <p>
            In Sanskrit, the words "Pitru" and "Paksha" denote the predecessors
            or forefathers and the time, respectively. Every year around this
            time, individuals make food gifts to their ancestors. It is one of
            the most significant times in Hinduism.
          </p>
          <p>
            People think that honouring our ancestors or progenitors will result
            in divine favours. Invoking the divine's favour is a lucky thing to
            do since Pitru paksha shradh appeases the Hindu God. The primary
            goal of this rite, however, is to ask God to pardon the ancestors'
            previous transgressions or crimes.
          </p>
          <h3>Significance of Pitru Paksha</h3>
          <p>
            In Hinduism, Pitru Paksha, also known as Shradh, has long held great
            significance. Let's elaborate on this subject below.

              That is why all of the actions are carried out in an effort to

              Pitrilok is the name of a world that is thought to be situated

          <p>
            It is important for everyone with Pitra Dosh in their horoscope to
            be aware of this. Pitra Dosh is a karma debt owed by our ancestors
            that is said to have a detrimental effect on the following
            generation. The current generation's life is expected to be affected
            by these issues and obstacles. Even the planets are dislocated from
            their appropriate homes during this period.
