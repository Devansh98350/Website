            calendar. This significant day in the Hindu calendar, occurring
            monthly when the moon shines at its brightest and fullest, derives

            completion of one lunar month and the commencement of another. On
            this day, it is believed that the moon is closest to Earth, exerting
            its strongest gravitational pull. This celestial alignment enhances
            the success of any prayers or rituals conducted, making it a
            propitious time for spiritual practices.
          </p>

            Purnima is closely intertwined with various Hindu festivals like
            Holi, Raksha Bandhan, and Guru Purnima, all celebrated with immense
            joy and fervour across the globe. In Hindu mythology, Purnima holds
            the honour of being Lord Buddha's birthday, the revered founder of
            Buddhism. Additionally, it is believed to be the day when Lord
            Vishnu manifested in his Matsya avatar, resembling a fish.
          </p>
          <p>

          <h2>Legends related to Purnima</h2>
          <p>
            Purnima, with its deep spiritual resonance, unfolds stories that
            invite us to explore the heart of Hindu mythology.
          </p>
          <h3>Legend of Lord Buddha's Birth</h3>
          <p>
            Purnima reveals the enchanting story of Lord Buddha's birth, a
            momentous chapter in history. Queen Maya, on her way to her parents'
            home, unexpectedly gave birth to Lord Buddha in the tranquil embrace
            of a Lumbini garden. As Lord Buddha took his first seven steps, he
            declared that this birth would be his last on Earth, illuminating
            the spiritual significance of Purnima and the eternal quest for
            enlightenment.
          </p>
          <h3>Tale of Lord Vishnu's Matsya Avatar</h3>
          <p>
            Another captivating legend intertwines Purnima with Lord Vishnu's
            Matsya Avatar. It tells of Lord Vishnu, who assumed the form of a
            fish (Matsya) to rescue the world from a devastating flood. Guiding
            sage Manu to construct a life-saving ark, Lord Vishnu revealed his
            true form when the waters subsided, showcasing the power of
            unwavering devotion to Lord Vishnu.
          </p>
          <h3>Purnima and the Festival of Holi</h3>
          <p>
            Purnima shares a close bond with the vibrant festival of Holi. The
            legend recounts the demon king Hiranyakashipu's malevolent
            intentions towards his devoted son, Prahlad. Holika, immune to fire,
            was tasked with a sinister mission but met her demise, while Prahlad
            emerged unharmed, protected by Lord Vishnu. This timeless tale
            symbolises the triumph of good over evil and the indomitable power
            of devotion.
          </p>
          <h3>Saga of Guru Purnima</h3>
          <p>
            Furthermore, Purnima commemorates Guru Purnima, a day dedicated to
            honouring teachers and spiritual guides. This legend narrates the
            story of the sage Vyasa, the revered author of the Mahabharata,
            seeking spiritual wisdom from his disciple, Shuka, while Shuka, in
            turn, sought knowledge of the material world from Vyasa. This
            exchange of wisdom between guru and disciple is celebrated on Guru
            Purnima, highlighting the profound importance of learning from our
            mentors.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the year 2025, as Purnima graces us with its radiant presence,
            these legends beckon us to delve into the rich tapestry of spiritual
            and cultural significance that weaves through this celestial
            phenomenon.
          </p>
          <h3>Significance of Purnima Vrat</h3>
          <p>
            Purnima, also known as Full Moon Day, is a special occasion in
            Hinduism, and it's worth understanding its significance as we
            approach Purnima in 2025. This day marks the end of one lunar month
            and the start of another. The moon is closest to Earth, making
            spiritual practices and rituals more effective.
          </p>
          <p>
            Purnima is not just a date on the calendar; it's interwoven with
            Hindu festivals like Holi, Raksha Bandhan, and Guru Purnima. These
            celebrations bring people together for prayers, rituals, and shared
            happiness.
          </p>
          <p>
            It's also a day for self-reflection. Take a moment to think about
            your spiritual journey and seek enlightenment. Many observe Purnima
            Vrat and do acts of kindness to cleanse their souls and gain merit.
          </p>
          <p>
            But Purnima is more than just a spiritual day. It aligns with the
            natural cycle of life. The full moon represents abundance and the
            rewards of hard work. It's a time to celebrate the harvest and be
            thankful for nature's blessings. Purnima also honours the mother
            goddess, symbolising fertility and nurturing. It's a day for paying
            respect to feminine energy.
          </p>
          <p>
            In 2025, as Purnima approaches, remember its spiritual and cultural
            significance. It's a time for reflection, religious devotion, and
            joyous celebrations. It signifies the end of one lunar cycle and the
            start of another, an opportunity to seek enlightenment, give thanks
            to nature, and honour the mother goddess.

          <p>
            Purnima Puja is a Hindu ritual worship performed on the full moon
