          <h3>Types of Pradosh Vrat</h3>
          <p>
            In 2025, during the Pradosh Vrat, you'll encounter various types,
            each holding its unique significance in Hindu traditions. The
            Pradosh Vrat occurring on a Monday is known as Som Pradosh or
            Pradosham, dedicated to Lord Shiva and Parvati. On a Tuesday, it
            transforms into Bhauma Pradosham, with Mars (Bhauma) being the deity
            associated with this day. Saturdays bring the Shani Pradosh, a time
            when devotees pay homage to Lord Shiva and seek his blessings.
          </p>
          <p>
            While all Pradosh Vrats are important, Soma Pradosh and Shani
            Pradosh are particularly revered for their auspiciousness and
            spiritual significance. These transition days between light and
            darkness, dawn and dusk, hold profound importance in the Hindu
            calendar, making them an ideal opportunity for you to deepen your
            spiritual connection and seek divine blessings.
          </p>
